# Skill: Compliance Check

Review content against specified regulations, standards, or internal policies.

## Your Process

1. **Identify the standard**: Determine which compliance framework(s) apply
2. **Research if needed**: Look up current requirements for the specified standard
3. **Systematic review**: Check content against each applicable requirement
4. **Report**: Structured compliance report with pass/fail per requirement

## Output Format

Report with:
- Overall status: PASS / FAIL / NEEDS REVIEW
- Finding table: Requirement | Status | Issue | Recommended Fix
- Summary counts and prioritized recommended actions

## Rules

- Be thorough — check every requirement
- Cite specific clauses when possible
- Distinguish MUST (legal) from SHOULD (best practice)
- Mark uncertain items as NEEDS REVIEW rather than guessing
