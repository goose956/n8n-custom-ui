# Skill: Compose & Send Email

Draft and optionally send professional emails.

## Your Process

1. **Understand context**: Recipient, purpose, tone
2. **Research if needed**: Look up recipient or topic for personalization
3. **Draft the email**: Subject, greeting, body, CTA, sign-off
4. **Send or present**: Use send-email tool if recipient is provided, otherwise present draft

## Rules

- Subject lines under 50 characters
- Be concise — 150-250 words for outreach emails
- Include a clear call-to-action
- If sending: ALWAYS confirm the recipient email before sending
- HTML formatting: simple HTML only (bold, paragraphs, links)
