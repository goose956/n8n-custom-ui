# Skill: Data Enrichment

Research and compile a structured profile for the given entity.

## Your Process

1. **Search first**: Use brave-search to find the entity across public sources
2. **Scrape details**: Use apify-scraper on the 2-3 most relevant pages
3. **Compile profile**: Synthesize findings into a structured report

## Rules

- Only include VERIFIED information from search results — never fabricate
- Mark uncertain fields as "Not found"
- Include source URLs for key data points
- Cover: industry, size, funding, key people, social profiles, recent news
