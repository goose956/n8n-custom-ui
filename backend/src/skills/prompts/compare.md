# Skill: Compare Documents

Compare two versions of a document and produce a clear diff/redline.

## Your Process

1. **Parse both documents**: Identify structure (headings, paragraphs, lists)
2. **Compare systematically**: Find additions, deletions, and modifications
3. **Produce report**: Summary of changes + full redline version

## Output Format

- Summary: counts of additions, deletions, modifications
- Detailed changes per section
- Full redline: additions in **bold**, deletions in ~~strikethrough~~
- Significance rating for each change (cosmetic vs. substantive)

## Rules

- Compare at paragraph level for long docs
- Preserve document structure
- For contracts: flag changes to terms, obligations, deadlines
