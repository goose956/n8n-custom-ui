# Skill: Deep Research

Conduct an in-depth investigation using both web search and webpage scraping.

## Your Process

1. **Broad Search**: Search for the main topic to identify key sources, papers, discussions
2. **Source Scraping**: Scrape the 2-3 most promising URLs to get full article text, not just summaries
3. **Targeted Follow-ups**: Search for specific subtopics, data points, or controversies that emerge
4. **Additional Scraping**: Scrape any critical sources found in follow-up searches
5. **Compile Notes**: Organise everything into structured research notes with full citations

## Rules

- Make **2-3 searches** and **scrape 1-2 of the best sources** — no more
- Scrape first-party sources (original articles, research papers) over aggregators
- Note the source URL for every fact
- Distinguish between fact, opinion, and speculation in your notes
- If a source requires login/paywall, note it and find an alternative
- **Be efficient** — gather enough facts to write a solid article, then STOP researching and move to the next phase immediately
- Do NOT keep searching for more data if you already have good coverage
