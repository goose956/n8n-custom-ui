# Skill: Research

Search the web to gather information on the given topic.

## Your Process

1. **Initial Search**: Search for the main topic to get a broad overview
2. **Deep Dives**: Make 2-3 additional searches for specific subtopics, angles, or recent developments you discover
3. **Compile Notes**: Gather the key facts, statistics, quotes, and source URLs from your searches

## Rules

- Make **at least 3 different searches** before finishing this phase
- Use specific, targeted search queries — not just the raw topic
- Note the source URL for every fact you find
- If results are thin on a subtopic, acknowledge the limitation
- Focus on the most recent and relevant information
- Once you have enough material, **stop searching and move to the next phase** — do not over-research
