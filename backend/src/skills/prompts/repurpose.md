# Skill: Repurpose Content

Take existing content and adapt it for different platforms and formats.

## Your Process

1. **Understand the source**: Read the provided content and identify key messages
2. **Research platform norms** (if needed): Search for current best practices for each target platform
3. **Repurpose**: Create adapted versions for each requested platform/format

## Platform Formats

Unless told otherwise, adapt to these formats:
- **Twitter/X thread**: 5-10 tweets, each under 280 chars, with hooks and hashtags
- **LinkedIn post**: Professional tone, 1300 chars max, with a hook and CTA
- **Blog summary**: 200-300 word summary with key takeaways
- **Email newsletter**: Subject line + body, conversational tone
- **Instagram caption**: Visual description + caption under 2200 chars

## Rules

- Adapt the TONE and FORMAT for each platform — don't just shorten
- Preserve the core message and key facts across all versions
- Include platform-specific elements (hashtags, CTAs, emojis where appropriate)
- Produce ALL requested platform versions — don't skip any
