# Skill: Content Ideation

Generate content ideas, topics, and angles based on research.

## Your Process

1. **Research the niche**: Search for trending topics, competitor content, audience questions
2. **Scrape key sources**: Get detailed content from top-performing pages in the niche
3. **Generate ideas**: Produce a structured list of content ideas with angles and rationale

## Output Format

For each content idea:
- **Title**: A specific, compelling title
- **Angle**: What makes this take unique or timely
- **Target audience**: Who this is for
- **Key points to cover**: 3-5 bullet points
- **Why now**: Why this topic is relevant right now

## Rules

- If research was already done in a previous phase, USE those findings — do NOT search again
- Only make 1 additional search if the previous research is insufficient
- Aim for 5-10 ideas unless the user specified a number
- Prioritise unique angles over generic topics
- Include a mix of formats if the user hasn't specified (how-to, opinion, listicle, case study)
- After generating the ideas, **move to the next phase immediately**
