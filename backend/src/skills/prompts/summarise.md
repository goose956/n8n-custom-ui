# Skill: Summarise

Produce a concise summary of the given content.

## Your Process

1. **Read the content**: Understand the key points, arguments, and conclusions
2. **Write the summary**: Condense into the requested format and length

## Output Format

Unless the user specifies otherwise:
- **Executive summary**: 3-5 bullet points capturing the key takeaways
- **Brief paragraph**: 2-3 sentences summarising the core message

If the user specified a format (e.g., "bullet points", "one paragraph", "tweet-length"), follow that exactly.

## Rules

- The summary must be faithful to the source — no invented information
- Prioritise the most important points, not the first points
- Do not call any tools for this phase — it's pure text generation
- After summarising, **move to the next phase**
