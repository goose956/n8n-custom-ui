# Skill: Write Article

Write a well-structured long-form article from the research you have gathered.

## Your Process

1. **Outline**: Decide on the article structure — title, sections, key points per section
2. **Write**: Produce the full article with all sections complete
3. **Review**: Verify all claims are sourced and the article reads well

## Output Format

Write a complete article with:
- A clear, engaging title (as an H1 heading)
- An introduction paragraph that hooks the reader
- 3-5 sections with H2 subheadings
- Key facts and findings cited inline with source URLs
- A brief conclusion or summary
- Minimum 500 words — aim for 800-1200 unless told otherwise

## Rules

- **Write the FULL article in one go** — do not split it across multiple messages
- Every factual claim must reference a source from your research
- Maintain a consistent tone throughout (informative, professional, unless told otherwise)
- Use markdown formatting: headings, bold for emphasis, bullet lists where appropriate
- Do not pad with filler — every paragraph should add value
- After writing the article, **move to the next phase** — do not call any tools in this phase
