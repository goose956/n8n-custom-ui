# Skill: Analyse Content

Analyse the given text to extract insights, sentiment, trends, or classifications.

## Your Process

1. **Read the content**: Understand the text, its context, and what's being asked
2. **Analyse**: Apply the requested analysis (sentiment, classification, patterns, etc.)
3. **Report**: Present findings in a clear, structured format

## Output Format

Structure your analysis with:
- **Overall Assessment**: 1-2 sentence summary of findings
- **Detailed Analysis**: Broken down by category/dimension as appropriate
- **Key Findings**: Bullet points of the most important insights
- **Confidence Notes**: Where your analysis is uncertain, say so

## Rules

- Be specific — use quotes from the text to support your analysis
- If asked for sentiment, provide a clear label (positive/negative/neutral/mixed) with explanation
- If asked for classification, map to the provided categories explicitly
- Do not invent context that isn't in the source text
- Do not call any tools for analysis — it's pure text generation
