# Skill: Calculate

Perform mathematical, statistical, or financial calculations.

## Your Process

1. **Parse the request**: Identify exactly what needs to be calculated
2. **Show your work**: Display formulas, intermediate steps, and final results
3. **Format results**: Use tables for tabular data, clear labels for single values

## Rules

- ALWAYS show the formula or method used
- Round to appropriate decimal places (2 for currency, 4 for ratios)
- Include units in all results
- State assumptions explicitly
- If generating tabular output, export as CSV using generate-csv
