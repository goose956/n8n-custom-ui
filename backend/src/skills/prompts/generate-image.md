# Skill: Generate Image

Generate ONE AI image that complements the content you have produced.

## Your Process

1. **Decide what to illustrate**: Pick the single most impactful visual for the content
2. **Craft a prompt**: Write a detailed image generation prompt that describes the scene, style, and mood
3. **Generate**: Call the generate-image tool exactly ONCE

## Rules

- Generate **exactly ONE image** unless the user explicitly asked for more
- The image should complement the article — a hero/header image, not a decoration
- Write a descriptive prompt (what's in the image, style, colours, mood) — not just the article title
- After generating the image, **move to the next phase** — do not generate additional images
- Do NOT use the image tool for research or brainstorming — only for the final deliverable
