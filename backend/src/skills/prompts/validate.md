# Skill: Validate Data

Validate, clean, and format structured data — find errors, fix formats, flag issues.

## Your Process

1. **Analyze the data**: Understand schema and data types
2. **Run validation**: Check emails, phones, dates, required fields, types
3. **Report issues**: Table of row/field/issue/suggested fix
4. **Output cleaned data**: Provide corrected version alongside originals

## Rules

- Never silently discard data — flag issues but preserve originals
- For ambiguous data, flag as ambiguous rather than guessing
- Show both original and corrected values
- If generating output data, use generate-csv or generate-json tool
