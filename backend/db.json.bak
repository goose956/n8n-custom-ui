      "output": "# Celtic FC: A Comprehensive Overview of Scotland's Football Giant\n\nCeltic Football Club, based in Glasgow, Scotland, is not just a football team; it is an institution in Scottish sports and culture. Founded in 1887, Celtic has established itself as one of the most successful and storied clubs in the world. This article delves into the club's rich history, recent performance, player transfers, and more.\n\n## A Brief History of Celtic FC\n\nCeltic was founded by Brother Walfrid, a Marist brother, to alleviate poverty in the East End of Glasgow. The club quickly rose to prominence, becoming one of the two major forces in Scottish football, alongside their fierce rivals, Rangers. As of 2023, Celtic has won the Scottish league championship a staggering 108 times and has a remarkable trophy haul exceeding 100 titles, making it one of the most decorated clubs worldwide ([BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/celtic), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.)).\n\nThe club's most significant achievement came in 1967 when they became the first British team to win the European Cup, defeating Inter Milan in the final. This victory solidified their place in football history and remains a cherished memory among supporters.\n\n## Recent Performance and Matches in 2023\n\nIn the 2023 season, Celtic has continued to perform strongly in the Scottish Premiership. They have demonstrated resilience, notably recovering from a two-goal deficit to secure a dramatic late win against Kilmarnock. Recent matches include a convincing 3-0 victory, showing their dominance in Scottish football ([Celtic FC Fixtures](https://www.celticfc.com/fixtures/), [The Celtic Wiki](https://www.thecelticwiki.com/season-review-2023-24/)). \n\nDespite facing some challenging fixtures, Celtic's squad depth and tactical prowess under manager Brendan Rodgers have kept them competitive. Their strong form suggests they are well-positioned to contend for the league title once again.\n\n## Player Transfers and Squad Updates\n\nCeltic has been active in the transfer market, looking to strengthen their squad for the ongoing season. Recent transfer news has seen significant signings aimed at bolstering both the attacking and defensive units. The club's commitment to nurturing young talent while also acquiring experienced players has been evident in their transfer strategy ([Celtic FC News](https://www.celticfc.com/news/), [NewsNow](https://www.newsnow.co.uk/h/Sport/Football/SPFL/Celtic)).\n\nThe club's management has emphasized the importance of building a squad capable of competing in both domestic and European competitions. This includes scouting talents not just from Scotland but across Europe, ensuring they remain a competitive force on multiple fronts.\n\n## Player Performance and Statistics\n\nCeltic's current squad boasts a mix of experienced veterans and exciting young talents. Players have shown impressive statistics in terms of goals, assists, and overall contributions to the team's performance. The club's attacking prowess has been highlighted by top scorers who consistently find the back of the net and contribute to the team's overall success ([Celtic Team Stats](https://theathletic.com/football/team/celtic-fc/stats/), [FootyStats](https://footystats.org/clubs/celtic-fc-23)).\n\nDefensively, Celtic has also improved, with their backline becoming more organized and effective at limiting the opposition's scoring opportunities. This balance between attacking flair and defensive solidity is crucial for their aspirations in both league and cup competitions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCeltic FC continues to be a pillar of Scottish football, characterized by its rich history, passionate fanbase, and relentless pursuit of success. With recent performances showing promise and an active approach in the transfer market, the club aims to solidify its status as a dominant force in Scottish and European football. The coming months will be critical as Celtic looks to maintain its competitive edge and achieve its ambitious goals.\n\nFor more information, you can visit the [official Celtic FC website](https://www.celticfc.com/) and stay updated with their latest news and fixtures.",

      "output": "# Research Report: Building a Garden Office\n\n## Executive Summary\nBuilding a garden office has become an increasingly popular solution for remote workers seeking a dedicated workspace. This report synthesizes information on the construction process, costs, design considerations, and planning permissions necessary for establishing a garden office. The findings indicate that a DIY approach can significantly reduce costs while offering customization opportunities, but careful planning is essential in terms of design, materials, and compliance with local regulations.\n\n## Key Findings\n- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Building a garden office yourself can save a significant amount compared to purchasing pre-made structures, with DIY projects reportedly costing between £450 and £5,000 depending on specifications and materials used [Source #1][Source #3].\n- **Design Flexibility**: DIY garden offices allow for extensive personalization, including size, layout, and materials, which fosters a sense of ownership and satisfaction [Source #2][Source #3].\n- **Planning Permissions**: Most garden offices are subject to permitted development rights, but specific regulations apply, especially concerning size, height, and proximity to boundaries [Source #5][Source #7].\n- **Insulation and Comfort**: Effective insulation is crucial for temperature control and condensation prevention, distinguishing garden offices from standard garden sheds [Source #4][Source #6].\n- **Construction Steps**: Common steps include ground preparation, framing, wall and roof construction, and installation of utilities, which require basic DIY skills and tools [Source #2][Source #3].\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n### 1. Cost Considerations\nBuilding a garden office can be a cost-effective alternative to traditional home extensions. Reports suggest that while professional builds can range from £500 to over £2,000 per square meter, DIY projects can be executed for significantly less. For instance, one DIY project reported a total cost of approximately £547 for a fully insulated and double-glazed office [Source #1]. Another source indicated a typical budget of around £4,500 for a quality garden office build [Source #7].\n\n### 2. Design and Personalization\nOne of the primary advantages of building a garden office is the ability to customize it to meet personal needs. From choosing the layout to selecting materials, DIY enthusiasts can create a workspace tailored to their preferences. Features such as double-glazing, insulation, and additional electrical installations help enhance comfort and functionality [Source #2][Source #5]. \n\n### 3. Planning Permissions and Regulations\nBefore starting a garden office project, it is vital to understand local planning regulations. Most garden offices fall under permitted development rights, provided they meet specific criteria: they should not occupy more than 50% of the garden area and must adhere to height limitations (3m for flat roofs, 4m for pitched roofs). Structures close to boundaries may require additional permissions [Source #4][Source #6].\n\n### 4. Construction Process\nThe construction of a garden office typically follows these steps:\n- **Groundworks**: Ensuring a level base is crucial for stability. This often involves laying concrete slabs or using gravel for drainage.\n- **Framing**: Building a robust frame using treated timber is essential for structural integrity. Walls are often insulated to enhance energy efficiency [Source #3].\n- **Roofing**: Different roofing options are available, including flat and pitched roofs; waterproofing and insulation are key considerations [Source #2][Source #5].\n- **Utilities Installation**: Depending on usage, electrical installations may be necessary, which could involve consulting a qualified electrician [Source #7].\n\n### 5. Benefits of a Garden Office\nA garden office provides a serene working environment separate from home distractions, promoting productivity. Additionally, it can enhance property value and provide a flexible space for various uses, from work to leisure [Source #6][Source #7].\n\n## Source Comparison\n- **Agreement**: All sources agree on the benefits of DIY construction regarding cost savings and customization. They emphasize the importance of planning permissions and insulation for functionality.\n- **Disagreement**: Some sources offer varying estimates on costs and timelines for construction, reflecting personal experiences and project scopes. For instance, one DIY project was completed at a fraction of the cost of others [Source #1][Source #3].\n\n## Sources\n1.

The room is actually going to be a garden studio for my daughter but the construction methods and end result are exactly the same if you are building an office for yourself.\nCheap Garden Office Ideas\nWhilst there are many ways to create a cheap garden office ranging from converting your existing shed into a garden office shed, using your summer house to building your own garden office. If you want a room that you are going to be comfortable working in all year round you really need to build your own garden office. If you are looking for cheap garden office ideas a home build is a great idea!\nYou will need a bit of wood working / building ability but I had never built one before and have managed to do a reasonable job! \nOne thing to really consider is heating / cooling. As if you get this wrong it’s going to be cold in the winter and really hot in the summer! \nHow to build a garden room on a budget\nThis is a DIY garden office build with recycled materials.\nThe project has started with the acquisition of some double glazed windows and french doors from a conservatory that was being dismantled near me. I don’t have any garden office plans, just a vision in my head which I hope to bring to life over the next few weeks. Where possible all the materials will be sourced as cheaply as possible to keep the cost down but without affecting the quality of the build.\nI must clarify that I am not a builder or have any experience in the construction of garden buildings. Everything I am learning is from research of garden office designs and building methods, youtube and a just do it attitude.\nHi, my name is Roger Perkin. I am actually a Network & Security Consultant, I am CCIE #50038 and if you want to read about Network Automation check out my pages on Network Automation\nThis build started on 31st March 2017\nGarden Office Construction – Day 1\nHere you can see the piece of land I have at the bottom of my garden. A few of the windows can be seen against the fence. The building will be 12ft x 8ft. The first job is to dig some holes to put in the footings. Building a garden office by yourself is a big task, but the summer is coming and I am looking forward to some long evenings working in the garden. The spec of this building will be that of a professionally built building like one of these but at a fraction of the cost. I am not a builder just a keen DIYer – I have no plans at the moment just a size and some windows!\nIf you want to know how to build a garden room on a budget keep reading.\nGarden Office Build Day 2 – Outside frame completed\nI have now completed the frame showing the full size of the office, I have put down four concrete blocks sat on concrete foot plates to support the frame, I still need to add another five and then fill in the joists inside the frame.\nThe frame is constructed from 6×2 tanalised timber held together with 4″ screws. The concrete foot plates are 6″ deep and made from a 5:1 mix of ballast and cement. The concrete blocks sit just proud of the lawn allowing a few inches under the building to allow for good air flow.\nDay 3 – Base nearly complete\nI have made some good progress today and am 3/4 of the way to finishing the base. I have sunk 4 more concrete blocks in the ground and now have all the supporting points covered. I have also put a central 6×2 running the full length of the base, and am hanging all the joists from it. This will give the base more strength. I have also acquired some 100m Celotex insulation from a skip at my daughters school this is going to be put in the base.\nDay 4 – I got some reclaimed wood for the walls.\nThe wall construction is going to be made with 3×1 softwood. Pricing this up it was coming in at around £3 per length of 2.4m – I am going to need about 60 lengths for the walls a total of £180. Onto my favourite site Gumtree and found a local builder not 5 miles from my house who was clearing some 3×1 timber! I picked up 60 various lengths all over 2.4M plus some 4×2 tanalised timber for roof joists (more on that in a few weeks) for a grand total of £70. The roof joists were going to cost me nearly £80 so today I have saved myself £190! Building a garden room is turning out to be more fun than I thought – saving money as well is also a bonus!\nI am now on the hunt for some more insulation.\nAll the wood was dry and straight so a real bargain!\nI took no time in constructing the first wall. Very simply I worked out the height of the building at the back needed to be 6′ 7″ so I made a square frame and then cut 5 more pieces to make the uprights. I screwed in 3 of these and then located the first window in the frame and added the remaining uprights to either side of the window giving it some strength. A simple cross beam with some supports underneath the window and one wall is finished.\nThe next task is to finish the base, get some more insulation in there and lay a floor. So I am now looking for some celotex insulation and 18mm OSB3 boards.\nSo back onto Gumtree and I have found 12 sheets of 25mm Celotex for £5 a sheet – which is a bargain so I bought the lot. I had to chop it in half to fit into my car!\nI finished insulating the floor and used 2 sheets putting 50mm under the floor which I used 18mm OSB for. Then got straight into the walls. I am using some reclaimed 3×1/2″ timber and framing each wall. For the back I constructed 3 sections and clad it with 11mm OSB before screwing them into the floor. Started progress on the roof using 4×2 tanalised timber and also enlisted some help to paint the OSB boards before the were installed facing the fence, never to be seen again!\nMy daughter is painting the second back wall section and we soon had all the back walls up.\nThe next step is to finish the front. I had acquired another window from ebay as I was looking for a window that spanned the full width of the space. I found a mis-measure window on ebay that was exactly the right size for me. This was a brand new window that had never been installed and using K Glass. This window is better than what I have in my house!\nSo I now have the window installed as well, the next step is to finish the roof (or at least get a covering of OSB up there) and then get the doors on.\nFor the roof I have 4×2 tanalised timber at 16″ spacing this will be covered with 18mm OSB and then finally an EPDM roof.\nWith the roof on I can install the doors – this was very simple as the frame simply screws into the wood frame of the building. The two doors were lifted into place and the hinges screwed into the frame. The building is now semi-water tight and could withstand a light shower.\nSelf Build your own Garden Room – Phase #1 complete\nIt is starting to look the buildings in the brochures! Can’t believe it has come this far. The next step is to get an EPDM roof on and then I am going to be working on the insulation on the inside and starting the first fit on the electrics for lights and sockets.\nSelf Build Garden Room Cost\nTotal cost of the build so far is £547 which I don’t think is bad for a completely bespoke 12×8 garden office fully insulated and double glazed.\nI will say that the Ryobi Drill is the best drill I have ever owned, and for only £129 it’s very good value. It has now helped me build 2 garden offices and is still going strong.\nShopping List\n1 x UPVC French door plus 4 windows – (dismantled conservatory) £100\n6×2 Floor Joists £99\nBullet Screws – £18\nhttps://www.travisperkins.co.uk/Bullet-Gold-Wood-Screws-Pack-of-200—5-0-x-100mm/p/107803\nInsulation – £50 (Gumtree)\nConcrete Blocks, Cement, Ballast and some sharp sand – £18\n60 lengths of 3×1 and 9 lengths of 4×2 tanalised roof joists (reclaimed from loc",

You can read all about my other two garden office builds in these articles:\nYou can download the full step-by-step build instruction for the above garden room here.\nNow, I’ll jump straight into the build for this DIY budget garden office. This build covers a combination of my DIY shed which I extended and insulated to make this garden office.\nStep-By-Step Guide for Building a Budget Garden Office\nGround Works\nLet’s kick things off with the groundwork for your garden office. I already had a reasonably flat surface with which to start the build. If your surface isn’t flat, you may want to invest in some landscaping. As mentioned above, this office is to be an extension of my original DIY shed, which I will also be insulating and boarding inside.\nLevelling the ground and placing the support slabs The original space before I made the first structure \nView my original post to see a full guide to building a base.\nI used some leftover type 1 MOT to provide a tough base with which to build on. I then laid out the 4 corner plinths to my required dimensions. I was a little restricted here due to an existing structure, so the overall dimensions for the base were 3250mm x 3000mm.\nThe Floor Frame for the Garden Building\nUsing one of the 3m C16 timber pieces I was able to dig out the ground and level the slabs using a large 1.8m spirit level.\nScrewing the frame together \nAs you can see I’ve built the frame directly off the original structure. Using 80mm screws to join the frame pieces together. Drilling pilot holes before inserting the screws. The spacing between each timber support is in intervals of 610mm which is half of the 1220mm wide 18mm MDF boards that will be fitted on top. \nTo protect the outer frame from water and possible rotting I wrapped each edge with the plastic sheeting. I simply stapled the plastic sheet to the wood with a staple gun.\nIt’s also at this point I made sure the frame was squared off, with each corner a right angle, by measuring diagonally (corner to opposite corner) and gently adjusting the frame until both lengths were exactly the same.\nIt’s now time to add some more supports to ensure there is sufficient strength for the floor. You can see I’ve added additional slabs so the floor doesn’t flex when additional weight is added. This required further digging and shifting of the MOT.\nAdditional support for the frame \nWith the correct measurements the 2440x1220mm 18mm thick MDF boards should fit neatly over this frame with suitable support. Make sure there is enough space so that the boards can be screwed into the frame alongside the other boards. Secure the boards down using 40mm (4mm wide) screws. \nTo finish off the base and floor, I added another full board and cut the remaining two to fit using a circular saw. If you have a good square base, everything should line up nicely down the edges. I made sure the boards go right up to the edge of the frame because I’ll cover the lot with some waterproof material. This will protect the flooring from being breached by water and causing it to rot.\nInsulating the Floor\nYou might want to consider insulating the floor before going any further with your garden office. I decided not to insulate at this point due to my budget, but I will add insulation afterwards. There is a great video below which demonstrates insulating the floor, but you will need to consider this early on in the build process.\nI have decided to insulate the floor retrospectively using this cork acoustic and thermal insulation roll. It won’t be as effective as the insulation in the above video, and it will raise the floor by about 10mm, but I’m happy with this.\nThe Garden Office Walls\nBuilding the wall frame is very straightforward. I started by adding the 90mm posts to the corner and measuring the distance in between. I then built another frame with the CLS timber measuring 2m tall and the correct length of the building. Struts were added in 600mm intervals to allow for the insulation to fit snugly between. Nogins were added 1200mm up from the base timber. (again for the insulation to fit nicely.)\nI made two of these the same. For the original structure, I made the rear wall the same (to the correct width) and added the roof supports afterwards.\nI haven’t added any windows to my office yet, but it’s at this point you should probably think about building a suitable frame if you’d like to add one (or more). They can be added after, but it’s a little more difficult.\nWindowed wall frame \nYou can find cheap windows on Facebook Marketplace or Gumtree, especially if you’re not fussed with the size. If you want something a little more specific, try Wickes or B&Q for windows or a local glazing company.\nThe wall frames were then screwed into the base using 80mm screws and screwed into the corner posts using 60mm screws.\nTo add additional strength to the structure, it’s a good idea to insert diagonal supports on some of the frames. This will prevent the frame from leaning should you ever add weight to the interior walls.\nI then measured out my door frame and cut the lengths of CLS to fit. The above picture demonstrates how I’ve constructed this. My door measured 1190mm x 2090mm, but I made sure the frame was about 3-5mm wider than this. This allowed me enough space to slide the door into the frame easily. The door comes with packers which fill any space and allow you to square up the door. It is crucial that the door is perfectly square, or it won’t open and close properly. I took my time on this part to ensure the timber frame was spot on.\nHere is a cross section diagram of the correct wall construction. You can also swap the 9mm OSB for 18mm OSB for a stronger more insulated wall.\nMaterials in order, starting from the inside:\nPlasterboard\n9mm OSB or ply board\nCLS timber frame\ninsulation\nBreathable membrane\nFurring strips\nCladding\nTo save money on my project I decided not to have the inner 9mm OSB/ply. I simply attached the plasterboard directly onto the CLS timber frame. This will save a reasonable amount of money but reduces the thermal properties of the structure.\nThe Garden Room Roof\nFor this I opted for a dual pitched roof supported by lengthways rafters running from end to end. Different to my original structure. Move the slider below to see the differences.\nBoth roof structures provide enough strength to take my full body weight. This is important as I needed to get on the roof to fit the felt. Visit my original post for the construction of the right hand image.\nI used the five 70x45mm C16 for the roof rafters. These were all screwed in using 80mm screws. As you can see above, I used the door frame to support the mid rafters. The side walls were used to support",

              "text": "How to build a garden office\nThere has never been a better time to work from home. Flexible working hours and the growth in new small businesses means that there is an increasing workforce ready to do just that and what nicer place than from a garden office or studio. Below are some tips on how to build your garden office, but don't forget to talk to your builder or planning council before starting anything.\nThe garden office is a prime location in which to work from home and there are many advantages to this option. Carving an office out of existing accommodation can be difficult, as there are so many competing pressures on space. In addition, many self-employed people find that they need to break away from the domestic environment where there are distractions – the journey to work, albeit a stroll down the garden path, is an essential commute that keeps home life and work separate.\nCareful planning\nIn general, most buildings provided by specialist home office suppliers will comply with, or be exempt from, planning permission. This relates to the volume of the building and to its overall height. Any garden office should not occupy an area more than 50 per cent of the garden space, with heights limited to 3m for a flat roof and 4m for a ridged roof. Structures should not be positioned between the house and the road and normally a distance of 20m from the road is applied. Any structures that do not comply with these basic rules will require planning permission. Regulations should be checked here. \nFor gardens within conservation areas, no garden office can be erected with a volume exceeding 10m3 without specific planning permission. This can be limiting, but informal discussions with local planners should prove supportive. Gardens within Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks will have similar limitations and the rules will need to be researched. Gardens associated with listed buildings will have specific constraints, often in the form of a ‘curtilage’. This relates to an ill-defined space around the building in which little or nothing can be built. Again, discussions with the local planning office prior to developing plans will help.\nFrom shed to office\nFor an effective garden office you will need to consider insulation as this will help to control temperatures across the seasons and prevent or reduce the effects of condensation. Essentially, this is what separates the garden office from the garden shed.\nYou may also need sound insulation, dependent upon your intended use. Double glazing, heating, lighting and mains connections for water and electricity increase the comfort levels and all-year-round usability. Many of the companies supplying the garden office structure will provide such services as part of the package, with some even negotiating with the planning department on your behalf. This provides a comfortable and basic office to which can be added a bathroom, shower room or sauna, creating a space flexible enough for overspill guest accommodation.\nLight & safety\nSecurity is a major issue as garden offices are an easy target for burglars, often built at some distance from the house and out of earshot. Door and window locks, together with an alarm system linked to the house, are all-important considerations. Consider orientation too, related to where in the office you will work. North-facing light is good as it avoids or minimises direct sunlight, or alternatively consider roof overhangs or veranda structures to reduce summer glare.\nThe garden office structures themselves are usually timber, coming in prefabricated panels to be built on site. Some are factory built and craned into position. They need a level surface and sit on concrete piles to minimise direct contact with the ground, with the building itself supported by a steel frame. Roof structures can be customised to take planting.\nMake a connection\nIf you are lucky enough to own convertible outbuildings, the main consideration would be internal fitting, servicing and insulation. Advice on such conversions would be best from local architects, who would also be of help with planning issues.

But where to begin with planning and building a garden office?\nFirstly, it’s important to consider how you’re going to use the garden office day-to-day and then you can draw up a list of essential features to include. For example, do you want to have running water available at all times? Maybe you’ll want to include underfloor heating, or even add a partition wall to break up the zones into separate work stations.

They tend to be affordable, easy to install (sometimes you can even buy a DIY garden office) and come in a variety of styles, materials and finishes.\nSo, there’s plenty of choice, and you can achieve an individual look without going through the rigmarole of a full design process.

Photo: Lorenzo Zandri\nIf you want something that’s perfectly tailored to your property and lifestyle, then consider a bespoke. This will allow you to cherry-pick the garden office’s size, layout and how it will sit within the context of your home and garden. You’ll also have more freedom over everything from external cladding materials to doors, windows, insulation type, flooring and more. So, it could be ideal if you want a high-spec design, you’re working to specific planning constraints, or you have a complex, tight garden space you want to make the most of.\nYou should also consider how the garden office will look in comparison to the style of your home. For instance, adding a new building that’s completely different to the style of your main build may look out of place and will create a disruption between the flow of your home and garden.

Heritage-style options are available in a range of colours and designs from many kit manufacturers. These tend to lean more towards orangery or conservatory-type structures but will add a great sense of elegance to your garden office design.\nDo You Need Planning Permission to Build a Garden Office?\nMost garden offices won’t require planning consent, as provided they’re at the rear of the property they’ll generally fall under permitted development (PD) rights. “Projects that can be achieved under PD will broadly speaking be a single-storey building with a maximum roof ridge height of 4m,” says Richard Keys, founding director of ByOthers Studio.\nFinished in Shou Sugi Ban charred timber cladding and constructed with SIPs, SilverLeaf Garden Rooms’ Natur Noir range is customisable with your choice of slimline aluminium bifold doors, windows or timber flooring, making a perfect option for your new garden office\nThe limits are stricter if the garden room is going to be close to a boundary. You’ll also need to consider the use of the building; anything that’s going to act as primary accommodation will require further applications, while features such as verandas don’t count as permitted development.\nIf you’re planning to use your garden office as a primary workplace for a business then you’ll need to consult your local planning authority, too. Holding meetings, having staff come and go, and using the garden office for frequent activity that may cause disturbance through noise or excessive parking will make an impact on whether or not your garden office will receive planning consent.\nPD rights are restricted for listed properties and those in designated areas, such as national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty. If you’re able to build your garden office under permitted development, it’ll be wise to consider a Lawful Development Certificate as this proves the work was permitted and will come in handy should you choose to sell your home.\nCLOSER LOOK Getting power to your garden office\nMost garden offices will require a power supply – whether that’s for a computer, lighting or electric underfloor heating. Varying needs will call for different installations, though, so before diving into a project, discuss with those who will use the space what your requirements are.\nHow can I get electricity to a garden office? \nIn most cases, an electrician can tap into your home’s consumer unit, providing it’s recently installed and up to standard. The power is then run through armoured cables along a fence or underground, which will depend on the buildings’ distance from one another. However, if you’re planning to include underfloor heating, electric showers or cookers, additional upgrades may be required. “A site survey is best for this element to confirm what work is required and the costs involved,” recommends Matthew Farrington.\nGoing off-grid can also prove a great, eco-friendly option, which is something to consider if you’re building your garden room a fair distance from the main house. “If you’re only needing a small supply, you may be able to look into installing a solar panel-charged battery pack for lighting and power,” says Richard Keys.\nWho should do these works? \nMost garden building suppliers will have qualified professionals on-hand, or you can source your own electrician locally. “Electrical installations in garden buildings will require certification to show that they comply with building and electrical safety regulations. A qualified electrician should provide a Part Q certificate to confirm that the work has been properly completed,” says Matthew.\nWhat should I budget when building my garden office? \nThe exact cost of electrical works for a garden office depends on a range of factors, from the age of the consumer unit to the distance between supplies and the level of groundworks needed.

              "text": "How to build a garden office\nThere has never been a better time to work from home. Flexible working hours and the growth in new small businesses means that there is an increasing workforce ready to do just that and what nicer place than from a garden office or studio. Below are some tips on how to build your garden office, but don't forget to talk to your builder or planning council before starting anything.\nThe garden office is a prime location in which to work from home and there are many advantages to this option. Carving an office out of existing accommodation can be difficult, as there are so many competing pressures on space. In addition, many self-employed people find that they need to break away from the domestic environment where there are distractions – the journey to work, albeit a stroll down the garden path, is an essential commute that keeps home life and work separate.\nCareful planning\nIn general, most buildings provided by specialist home office suppliers will comply with, or be exempt from, planning permission. This relates to the volume of the building and to its overall height. Any garden office should not occupy an area more than 50 per cent of the garden space, with heights limited to 3m for a flat roof and 4m for a ridged roof. Structures should not be positioned between the house and the road and normally a distance of 20m from the road is applied. Any structures that do not comply with these basic rules will require planning permission. Regulations should be checked here. \nFor gardens within conservation areas, no garden office can be erected with a volume exceeding 10m3 without specific planning permission. This can be limiting, but informal discussions with local planners should prove supportive. Gardens within Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks will have similar limitations and the rules will need to be researched. Gardens associated with listed buildings will have specific constraints, often in the form of a ‘curtilage’. This relates to an ill-defined space around the building in which little or nothing can be built. Again, discussions with the local planning office prior to developing plans will help.\nFrom shed to office\nFor an effective garden office you will need to consider insulation as this will help to control temperatures across the seasons and prevent or reduce the effects of condensation. Essentially, this is what separates the garden office from the garden shed.\nYou may also need sound insulation, dependent upon your intended use. Double glazing, heating, lighting and mains connections for water and electricity increase the comfort levels and all-year-round usability. Many of the companies supplying the garden office structure will provide such services as part of the package, with some even negotiating with the planning department on your behalf. This provides a comfortable and basic office to which can be added a bathroom, shower room or sauna, creating a space flexible enough for overspill guest accommodation.\nLight & safety\nSecurity is a major issue as garden offices are an easy target for burglars, often built at some distance from the house and out of earshot. Door and window locks, together with an alarm system linked to the house, are all-important considerations. Consider orientation too, related to where in the office you will work. North-facing light is good as it avoids or minimises direct sunlight, or alternatively consider roof overhangs or veranda structures to reduce summer glare.\nThe garden office structures themselves are usually timber, coming in prefabricated panels to be built on site. Some are factory built and craned into position. They need a level surface and sit on concrete piles to minimise direct contact with the ground, with the building itself supported by a steel frame. Roof structures can be customised to take planting.\nMake a connection\nIf you are lucky enough to own convertible outbuildings, the main consideration would be internal fitting, servicing and insulation. Advice on such conversions would be best from local architects, who would also be of help with planning issues. Staining can reduce the impact of the building, especially using darker colours, or link the building into other structures within the garden such as pergolas or arbours. Good supporting structural planting can also help to settle the new building into its location, as this will soften its outline and silhouette.\nFor the connection between the garden and garden office, decks are popular and appropriate as they deal with the raised level of the internal floor and suit the external timber finishes. The provision of an outdoor seating space outside the garden office makes the location within the garden much more tantalising, combined with French or sliding glass doors to open the office space to the garden in warmer weather.\nSize the external paved area according to your anticipated use – perhaps just three or four square metres if you are to work alone, 10-20 square metres if you expect to work with colleagues, or to bring your clients into the garden.\nThis expanded use can also impact on the wider garden and the means of access for you and your visitors. Consider pathway widths with 1.2m a recommended minimum, and how access to the garden gate or house is to be arranged.\nAs with any garden venture, it is important to take a wider view in order to optimise your investment as garden offices increasingly become bigger and bigger business.\nKEY POINTS TO TAKE AWAY\nMake comparisons between the various garden office companies, unless you intend to design and build yourself.

DIRECT ANSWER BLOCK (first 100 words)\n- Open with a concise, factual direct answer to the core question\n- LLMs pull from the first paragraph heavily - make it quotable\n- Format: \"[Topic] is/means [direct definition/answer]. [One supporting sentence with a data point].\"\n- This becomes the snippet LLMs cite\n\n### 2. KEY FACTS / AT A GLANCE BOX\n- Immediately after the intro, include a structured summary:\n`\n## Key Facts\n- **What**: [one-line definition]\n- **Why it matters**: [one-line impact]\n- **Key stat**: [most compelling data point with source]\n- **Last updated**: [current date]\n- **Bottom line**: [one-sentence takeaway]\n`\n\n### 3. TABLE OF CONTENTS\n- Include a markdown TOC with all H2 headings\n- LLMs use this to understand article structure\n\n### 4. QUESTION-BASED H2 HEADINGS\n- Every section heading should be a natural language question people actually ask\n- Example: \"## What Is [Topic]?\" not \"## Overview\"\n- Example: \"## How Does [Topic] Work?\" not \"## Functionality\"\n- Example: \"## What Are the Benefits of [Topic]?\" not \"## Benefits\"\n- LLMs match these to user queries\n\n### 5. STRUCTURED ANSWER PATTERN (for each section)\nEach section MUST follow this pattern:\n- **First sentence**: Direct answer to the heading question (quotable)\n- **Supporting paragraph**: Evidence, data, examples (2-3 sentences)\n- **Bullet points or numbered list**: Key details broken out\n- **Expert quote or data point**: Authority signal\n- LLMs prefer this structure because it's easy to extract\n\n### 6. COMPARISON TABLE\n- Include at least one markdown comparison table\n- Tables are heavily cited by LLMs for comparative queries\n- Example: comparing approaches, tools, pros/cons, before/after\n\n### 7. FAQ SECTION (CRITICAL)\n- Include 5-8 FAQs at the end in this exact format:\n`\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### [Question]?\n[2-3 sentence direct answer.]\n\n### [Question]?\n[2-3 sentence direct answer.]\n`\n- These map directly to \"People Also Ask\" and LLM follow-up queries\n- Each answer should be self-contained (quotable without context)\n\n### 8. STATISTICS & DATA POINTS\n- Include at least 5 specific stats/numbers throughout\n- Always cite the source: \"According to [Source], [stat] ([Year])\"\n- LLMs heavily favor content with verifiable data points\n- Use the most recent data available from your research\n\n### 9. DEFINITIONS & TERMINOLOGY\n- Define key terms inline using bold: **Term** - definition\n- LLMs pull these for definitional queries\n\n### 10. AUTHORITY SIGNALS\n- Mention specific sources by name (named experts, organizations, studies)\n- Use phrases like \"According to\", \"Research from [X] shows\", \"Experts at [Y] recommend\"\n- Include source URLs - LLMs check for citations\n\n### 11. FRESHNESS SIGNALS\n- Mention the current year and date where relevant\n- Use phrases like \"As of 2026\", \"The latest data shows\"\n- Reference recent developments from your research\n\n### 12. STRUCTURED CONCLUSION\n- Summarize in bullet points (not prose)\n- Include a \"Key Takeaways\" section:\n`\n## Key Takeaways\n- [Takeaway 1]\n- [Takeaway 2]\n- [Takeaway 3]\n`\n\n### 13. SCHEMA-FRIENDLY METADATA (at the very end)\nInclude this block:\n`\n---\n**Article Metadata**\n- Topic: [primary topic]\n- Primary Query: [main question this answers]\n- Related Queries: [3-5 related questions]\n- Last Updated: [date]\n- Content Type: [guide/comparison/explainer/how-to]\n- Word Count: [approximate]\n---\n`\n\n## Content Rules\n- Write 1500-2500 words (longer content gets more LLM citations)\n- Every claim should have a source or data point\n- Use simple, clear language - LLMs prefer low complexity for citation\n- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)\n- Heavy use of formatting: bold, lists, tables, headers\n- No fluff - every sentence should add information value\n- Cite sources inline with URLs from your research",
