      "output": "# Celtic FC: A Comprehensive Overview of Scotland's Football Giant\n\nCeltic Football Club, based in Glasgow, Scotland, is not just a football team; it is an institution in Scottish sports and culture. Founded in 1887, Celtic has established itself as one of the most successful and storied clubs in the world. This article delves into the club's rich history, recent performance, player transfers, and more.\n\n## A Brief History of Celtic FC\n\nCeltic was founded by Brother Walfrid, a Marist brother, to alleviate poverty in the East End of Glasgow. The club quickly rose to prominence, becoming one of the two major forces in Scottish football, alongside their fierce rivals, Rangers. As of 2023, Celtic has won the Scottish league championship a staggering 108 times and has a remarkable trophy haul exceeding 100 titles, making it one of the most decorated clubs worldwide ([BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/celtic), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.)).\n\nThe club's most significant achievement came in 1967 when they became the first British team to win the European Cup, defeating Inter Milan in the final. This victory solidified their place in football history and remains a cherished memory among supporters.\n\n## Recent Performance and Matches in 2023\n\nIn the 2023 season, Celtic has continued to perform strongly in the Scottish Premiership. They have demonstrated resilience, notably recovering from a two-goal deficit to secure a dramatic late win against Kilmarnock. Recent matches include a convincing 3-0 victory, showing their dominance in Scottish football ([Celtic FC Fixtures](https://www.celticfc.com/fixtures/), [The Celtic Wiki](https://www.thecelticwiki.com/season-review-2023-24/)). \n\nDespite facing some challenging fixtures, Celtic's squad depth and tactical prowess under manager Brendan Rodgers have kept them competitive. Their strong form suggests they are well-positioned to contend for the league title once again.\n\n## Player Transfers and Squad Updates\n\nCeltic has been active in the transfer market, looking to strengthen their squad for the ongoing season. Recent transfer news has seen significant signings aimed at bolstering both the attacking and defensive units. The club's commitment to nurturing young talent while also acquiring experienced players has been evident in their transfer strategy ([Celtic FC News](https://www.celticfc.com/news/), [NewsNow](https://www.newsnow.co.uk/h/Sport/Football/SPFL/Celtic)).\n\nThe club's management has emphasized the importance of building a squad capable of competing in both domestic and European competitions. This includes scouting talents not just from Scotland but across Europe, ensuring they remain a competitive force on multiple fronts.\n\n## Player Performance and Statistics\n\nCeltic's current squad boasts a mix of experienced veterans and exciting young talents. Players have shown impressive statistics in terms of goals, assists, and overall contributions to the team's performance. The club's attacking prowess has been highlighted by top scorers who consistently find the back of the net and contribute to the team's overall success ([Celtic Team Stats](https://theathletic.com/football/team/celtic-fc/stats/), [FootyStats](https://footystats.org/clubs/celtic-fc-23)).\n\nDefensively, Celtic has also improved, with their backline becoming more organized and effective at limiting the opposition's scoring opportunities. This balance between attacking flair and defensive solidity is crucial for their aspirations in both league and cup competitions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCeltic FC continues to be a pillar of Scottish football, characterized by its rich history, passionate fanbase, and relentless pursuit of success. With recent performances showing promise and an active approach in the transfer market, the club aims to solidify its status as a dominant force in Scottish and European football. The coming months will be critical as Celtic looks to maintain its competitive edge and achieve its ambitious goals.\n\nFor more information, you can visit the [official Celtic FC website](https://www.celticfc.com/) and stay updated with their latest news and fixtures.",

      "output": "# Research Report: Building a Garden Office\n\n## Executive Summary\nBuilding a garden office has become an increasingly popular solution for remote workers seeking a dedicated workspace. This report synthesizes information on the construction process, costs, design considerations, and planning permissions necessary for establishing a garden office. The findings indicate that a DIY approach can significantly reduce costs while offering customization opportunities, but careful planning is essential in terms of design, materials, and compliance with local regulations.\n\n## Key Findings\n- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Building a garden office yourself can save a significant amount compared to purchasing pre-made structures, with DIY projects reportedly costing between £450 and £5,000 depending on specifications and materials used [Source #1][Source #3].\n- **Design Flexibility**: DIY garden offices allow for extensive personalization, including size, layout, and materials, which fosters a sense of ownership and satisfaction [Source #2][Source #3].\n- **Planning Permissions**: Most garden offices are subject to permitted development rights, but specific regulations apply, especially concerning size, height, and proximity to boundaries [Source #5][Source #7].\n- **Insulation and Comfort**: Effective insulation is crucial for temperature control and condensation prevention, distinguishing garden offices from standard garden sheds [Source #4][Source #6].\n- **Construction Steps**: Common steps include ground preparation, framing, wall and roof construction, and installation of utilities, which require basic DIY skills and tools [Source #2][Source #3].\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n### 1. Cost Considerations\nBuilding a garden office can be a cost-effective alternative to traditional home extensions. Reports suggest that while professional builds can range from £500 to over £2,000 per square meter, DIY projects can be executed for significantly less. For instance, one DIY project reported a total cost of approximately £547 for a fully insulated and double-glazed office [Source #1]. Another source indicated a typical budget of around £4,500 for a quality garden office build [Source #7].\n\n### 2. Design and Personalization\nOne of the primary advantages of building a garden office is the ability to customize it to meet personal needs. From choosing the layout to selecting materials, DIY enthusiasts can create a workspace tailored to their preferences. Features such as double-glazing, insulation, and additional electrical installations help enhance comfort and functionality [Source #2][Source #5]. \n\n### 3. Planning Permissions and Regulations\nBefore starting a garden office project, it is vital to understand local planning regulations. Most garden offices fall under permitted development rights, provided they meet specific criteria: they should not occupy more than 50% of the garden area and must adhere to height limitations (3m for flat roofs, 4m for pitched roofs). Structures close to boundaries may require additional permissions [Source #4][Source #6].\n\n### 4. Construction Process\nThe construction of a garden office typically follows these steps:\n- **Groundworks**: Ensuring a level base is crucial for stability. This often involves laying concrete slabs or using gravel for drainage.\n- **Framing**: Building a robust frame using treated timber is essential for structural integrity. Walls are often insulated to enhance energy efficiency [Source #3].\n- **Roofing**: Different roofing options are available, including flat and pitched roofs; waterproofing and insulation are key considerations [Source #2][Source #5].\n- **Utilities Installation**: Depending on usage, electrical installations may be necessary, which could involve consulting a qualified electrician [Source #7].\n\n### 5. Benefits of a Garden Office\nA garden office provides a serene working environment separate from home distractions, promoting productivity. Additionally, it can enhance property value and provide a flexible space for various uses, from work to leisure [Source #6][Source #7].\n\n## Source Comparison\n- **Agreement**: All sources agree on the benefits of DIY construction regarding cost savings and customization. They emphasize the importance of planning permissions and insulation for functionality.\n- **Disagreement**: Some sources offer varying estimates on costs and timelines for construction, reflecting personal experiences and project scopes. For instance, one DIY project was completed at a fraction of the cost of others [Source #1][Source #3].\n\n## Sources\n1.

The room is actually going to be a garden studio for my daughter but the construction methods and end result are exactly the same if you are building an office for yourself.\nCheap Garden Office Ideas\nWhilst there are many ways to create a cheap garden office ranging from converting your existing shed into a garden office shed, using your summer house to building your own garden office. If you want a room that you are going to be comfortable working in all year round you really need to build your own garden office. If you are looking for cheap garden office ideas a home build is a great idea!\nYou will need a bit of wood working / building ability but I had never built one before and have managed to do a reasonable job! \nOne thing to really consider is heating / cooling. As if you get this wrong it’s going to be cold in the winter and really hot in the summer! \nHow to build a garden room on a budget\nThis is a DIY garden office build with recycled materials.\nThe project has started with the acquisition of some double glazed windows and french doors from a conservatory that was being dismantled near me. I don’t have any garden office plans, just a vision in my head which I hope to bring to life over the next few weeks. Where possible all the materials will be sourced as cheaply as possible to keep the cost down but without affecting the quality of the build.\nI must clarify that I am not a builder or have any experience in the construction of garden buildings. Everything I am learning is from research of garden office designs and building methods, youtube and a just do it attitude.\nHi, my name is Roger Perkin. I am actually a Network & Security Consultant, I am CCIE #50038 and if you want to read about Network Automation check out my pages on Network Automation\nThis build started on 31st March 2017\nGarden Office Construction – Day 1\nHere you can see the piece of land I have at the bottom of my garden. A few of the windows can be seen against the fence. The building will be 12ft x 8ft. The first job is to dig some holes to put in the footings. Building a garden office by yourself is a big task, but the summer is coming and I am looking forward to some long evenings working in the garden. The spec of this building will be that of a professionally built building like one of these but at a fraction of the cost. I am not a builder just a keen DIYer – I have no plans at the moment just a size and some windows!\nIf you want to know how to build a garden room on a budget keep reading.\nGarden Office Build Day 2 – Outside frame completed\nI have now completed the frame showing the full size of the office, I have put down four concrete blocks sat on concrete foot plates to support the frame, I still need to add another five and then fill in the joists inside the frame.\nThe frame is constructed from 6×2 tanalised timber held together with 4″ screws. The concrete foot plates are 6″ deep and made from a 5:1 mix of ballast and cement. The concrete blocks sit just proud of the lawn allowing a few inches under the building to allow for good air flow.\nDay 3 – Base nearly complete\nI have made some good progress today and am 3/4 of the way to finishing the base. I have sunk 4 more concrete blocks in the ground and now have all the supporting points covered. I have also put a central 6×2 running the full length of the base, and am hanging all the joists from it. This will give the base more strength. I have also acquired some 100m Celotex insulation from a skip at my daughters school this is going to be put in the base.\nDay 4 – I got some reclaimed wood for the walls.\nThe wall construction is going to be made with 3×1 softwood. Pricing this up it was coming in at around £3 per length of 2.4m – I am going to need about 60 lengths for the walls a total of £180. Onto my favourite site Gumtree and found a local builder not 5 miles from my house who was clearing some 3×1 timber! I picked up 60 various lengths all over 2.4M plus some 4×2 tanalised timber for roof joists (more on that in a few weeks) for a grand total of £70. The roof joists were going to cost me nearly £80 so today I have saved myself £190! Building a garden room is turning out to be more fun than I thought – saving money as well is also a bonus!\nI am now on the hunt for some more insulation.\nAll the wood was dry and straight so a real bargain!\nI took no time in constructing the first wall. Very simply I worked out the height of the building at the back needed to be 6′ 7″ so I made a square frame and then cut 5 more pieces to make the uprights. I screwed in 3 of these and then located the first window in the frame and added the remaining uprights to either side of the window giving it some strength. A simple cross beam with some supports underneath the window and one wall is finished.\nThe next task is to finish the base, get some more insulation in there and lay a floor. So I am now looking for some celotex insulation and 18mm OSB3 boards.\nSo back onto Gumtree and I have found 12 sheets of 25mm Celotex for £5 a sheet – which is a bargain so I bought the lot. I had to chop it in half to fit into my car!\nI finished insulating the floor and used 2 sheets putting 50mm under the floor which I used 18mm OSB for. Then got straight into the walls. I am using some reclaimed 3×1/2″ timber and framing each wall. For the back I constructed 3 sections and clad it with 11mm OSB before screwing them into the floor. Started progress on the roof using 4×2 tanalised timber and also enlisted some help to paint the OSB boards before the were installed facing the fence, never to be seen again!\nMy daughter is painting the second back wall section and we soon had all the back walls up.\nThe next step is to finish the front. I had acquired another window from ebay as I was looking for a window that spanned the full width of the space. I found a mis-measure window on ebay that was exactly the right size for me. This was a brand new window that had never been installed and using K Glass. This window is better than what I have in my house!\nSo I now have the window installed as well, the next step is to finish the roof (or at least get a covering of OSB up there) and then get the doors on.\nFor the roof I have 4×2 tanalised timber at 16″ spacing this will be covered with 18mm OSB and then finally an EPDM roof.\nWith the roof on I can install the doors – this was very simple as the frame simply screws into the wood frame of the building. The two doors were lifted into place and the hinges screwed into the frame. The building is now semi-water tight and could withstand a light shower.\nSelf Build your own Garden Room – Phase #1 complete\nIt is starting to look the buildings in the brochures! Can’t believe it has come this far. The next step is to get an EPDM roof on and then I am going to be working on the insulation on the inside and starting the first fit on the electrics for lights and sockets.\nSelf Build Garden Room Cost\nTotal cost of the build so far is £547 which I don’t think is bad for a completely bespoke 12×8 garden office fully insulated and double glazed.\nI will say that the Ryobi Drill is the best drill I have ever owned, and for only £129 it’s very good value. It has now helped me build 2 garden offices and is still going strong.\nShopping List\n1 x UPVC French door plus 4 windows – (dismantled conservatory) £100\n6×2 Floor Joists £99\nBullet Screws – £18\nhttps://www.travisperkins.co.uk/Bullet-Gold-Wood-Screws-Pack-of-200—5-0-x-100mm/p/107803\nInsulation – £50 (Gumtree)\nConcrete Blocks, Cement, Ballast and some sharp sand – £18\n60 lengths of 3×1 and 9 lengths of 4×2 tanalised roof joists (reclaimed from loc",

You can read all about my other two garden office builds in these articles:\nYou can download the full step-by-step build instruction for the above garden room here.\nNow, I’ll jump straight into the build for this DIY budget garden office. This build covers a combination of my DIY shed which I extended and insulated to make this garden office.\nStep-By-Step Guide for Building a Budget Garden Office\nGround Works\nLet’s kick things off with the groundwork for your garden office. I already had a reasonably flat surface with which to start the build. If your surface isn’t flat, you may want to invest in some landscaping. As mentioned above, this office is to be an extension of my original DIY shed, which I will also be insulating and boarding inside.\nLevelling the ground and placing the support slabs The original space before I made the first structure \nView my original post to see a full guide to building a base.\nI used some leftover type 1 MOT to provide a tough base with which to build on. I then laid out the 4 corner plinths to my required dimensions. I was a little restricted here due to an existing structure, so the overall dimensions for the base were 3250mm x 3000mm.\nThe Floor Frame for the Garden Building\nUsing one of the 3m C16 timber pieces I was able to dig out the ground and level the slabs using a large 1.8m spirit level.\nScrewing the frame together \nAs you can see I’ve built the frame directly off the original structure. Using 80mm screws to join the frame pieces together. Drilling pilot holes before inserting the screws. The spacing between each timber support is in intervals of 610mm which is half of the 1220mm wide 18mm MDF boards that will be fitted on top. \nTo protect the outer frame from water and possible rotting I wrapped each edge with the plastic sheeting. I simply stapled the plastic sheet to the wood with a staple gun.\nIt’s also at this point I made sure the frame was squared off, with each corner a right angle, by measuring diagonally (corner to opposite corner) and gently adjusting the frame until both lengths were exactly the same.\nIt’s now time to add some more supports to ensure there is sufficient strength for the floor. You can see I’ve added additional slabs so the floor doesn’t flex when additional weight is added. This required further digging and shifting of the MOT.\nAdditional support for the frame \nWith the correct measurements the 2440x1220mm 18mm thick MDF boards should fit neatly over this frame with suitable support. Make sure there is enough space so that the boards can be screwed into the frame alongside the other boards. Secure the boards down using 40mm (4mm wide) screws. \nTo finish off the base and floor, I added another full board and cut the remaining two to fit using a circular saw. If you have a good square base, everything should line up nicely down the edges. I made sure the boards go right up to the edge of the frame because I’ll cover the lot with some waterproof material. This will protect the flooring from being breached by water and causing it to rot.\nInsulating the Floor\nYou might want to consider insulating the floor before going any further with your garden office. I decided not to insulate at this point due to my budget, but I will add insulation afterwards. There is a great video below which demonstrates insulating the floor, but you will need to consider this early on in the build process.\nI have decided to insulate the floor retrospectively using this cork acoustic and thermal insulation roll. It won’t be as effective as the insulation in the above video, and it will raise the floor by about 10mm, but I’m happy with this.\nThe Garden Office Walls\nBuilding the wall frame is very straightforward. I started by adding the 90mm posts to the corner and measuring the distance in between. I then built another frame with the CLS timber measuring 2m tall and the correct length of the building. Struts were added in 600mm intervals to allow for the insulation to fit snugly between. Nogins were added 1200mm up from the base timber. (again for the insulation to fit nicely.)\nI made two of these the same. For the original structure, I made the rear wall the same (to the correct width) and added the roof supports afterwards.\nI haven’t added any windows to my office yet, but it’s at this point you should probably think about building a suitable frame if you’d like to add one (or more). They can be added after, but it’s a little more difficult.\nWindowed wall frame \nYou can find cheap windows on Facebook Marketplace or Gumtree, especially if you’re not fussed with the size. If you want something a little more specific, try Wickes or B&Q for windows or a local glazing company.\nThe wall frames were then screwed into the base using 80mm screws and screwed into the corner posts using 60mm screws.\nTo add additional strength to the structure, it’s a good idea to insert diagonal supports on some of the frames. This will prevent the frame from leaning should you ever add weight to the interior walls.\nI then measured out my door frame and cut the lengths of CLS to fit. The above picture demonstrates how I’ve constructed this. My door measured 1190mm x 2090mm, but I made sure the frame was about 3-5mm wider than this. This allowed me enough space to slide the door into the frame easily. The door comes with packers which fill any space and allow you to square up the door. It is crucial that the door is perfectly square, or it won’t open and close properly. I took my time on this part to ensure the timber frame was spot on.\nHere is a cross section diagram of the correct wall construction. You can also swap the 9mm OSB for 18mm OSB for a stronger more insulated wall.\nMaterials in order, starting from the inside:\nPlasterboard\n9mm OSB or ply board\nCLS timber frame\ninsulation\nBreathable membrane\nFurring strips\nCladding\nTo save money on my project I decided not to have the inner 9mm OSB/ply. I simply attached the plasterboard directly onto the CLS timber frame. This will save a reasonable amount of money but reduces the thermal properties of the structure.\nThe Garden Room Roof\nFor this I opted for a dual pitched roof supported by lengthways rafters running from end to end. Different to my original structure. Move the slider below to see the differences.\nBoth roof structures provide enough strength to take my full body weight. This is important as I needed to get on the roof to fit the felt. Visit my original post for the construction of the right hand image.\nI used the five 70x45mm C16 for the roof rafters. These were all screwed in using 80mm screws. As you can see above, I used the door frame to support the mid rafters. The side walls were used to support",

              "text": "How to build a garden office\nThere has never been a better time to work from home. Flexible working hours and the growth in new small businesses means that there is an increasing workforce ready to do just that and what nicer place than from a garden office or studio. Below are some tips on how to build your garden office, but don't forget to talk to your builder or planning council before starting anything.\nThe garden office is a prime location in which to work from home and there are many advantages to this option. Carving an office out of existing accommodation can be difficult, as there are so many competing pressures on space. In addition, many self-employed people find that they need to break away from the domestic environment where there are distractions – the journey to work, albeit a stroll down the garden path, is an essential commute that keeps home life and work separate.\nCareful planning\nIn general, most buildings provided by specialist home office suppliers will comply with, or be exempt from, planning permission. This relates to the volume of the building and to its overall height. Any garden office should not occupy an area more than 50 per cent of the garden space, with heights limited to 3m for a flat roof and 4m for a ridged roof. Structures should not be positioned between the house and the road and normally a distance of 20m from the road is applied. Any structures that do not comply with these basic rules will require planning permission. Regulations should be checked here. \nFor gardens within conservation areas, no garden office can be erected with a volume exceeding 10m3 without specific planning permission. This can be limiting, but informal discussions with local planners should prove supportive. Gardens within Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks will have similar limitations and the rules will need to be researched. Gardens associated with listed buildings will have specific constraints, often in the form of a ‘curtilage’. This relates to an ill-defined space around the building in which little or nothing can be built. Again, discussions with the local planning office prior to developing plans will help.\nFrom shed to office\nFor an effective garden office you will need to consider insulation as this will help to control temperatures across the seasons and prevent or reduce the effects of condensation. Essentially, this is what separates the garden office from the garden shed.\nYou may also need sound insulation, dependent upon your intended use. Double glazing, heating, lighting and mains connections for water and electricity increase the comfort levels and all-year-round usability. Many of the companies supplying the garden office structure will provide such services as part of the package, with some even negotiating with the planning department on your behalf. This provides a comfortable and basic office to which can be added a bathroom, shower room or sauna, creating a space flexible enough for overspill guest accommodation.\nLight & safety\nSecurity is a major issue as garden offices are an easy target for burglars, often built at some distance from the house and out of earshot. Door and window locks, together with an alarm system linked to the house, are all-important considerations. Consider orientation too, related to where in the office you will work. North-facing light is good as it avoids or minimises direct sunlight, or alternatively consider roof overhangs or veranda structures to reduce summer glare.\nThe garden office structures themselves are usually timber, coming in prefabricated panels to be built on site. Some are factory built and craned into position. They need a level surface and sit on concrete piles to minimise direct contact with the ground, with the building itself supported by a steel frame. Roof structures can be customised to take planting.\nMake a connection\nIf you are lucky enough to own convertible outbuildings, the main consideration would be internal fitting, servicing and insulation. Advice on such conversions would be best from local architects, who would also be of help with planning issues.

This will allow you to cherry-pick the garden office’s size, layout and how it will sit within the context of your home and garden. You’ll also have more freedom over everything from external cladding materials to doors, windows, insulation type, flooring and more. So, it could be ideal if you want a high-spec design, you’re working to specific planning constraints, or you have a complex, tight garden space you want to make the most of.\nYou should also consider how the garden office will look in comparison to the style of your home. For instance, adding a new building that’s completely different to the style of your main build may look out of place and will create a disruption between the flow of your home and garden.

Heritage-style options are available in a range of colours and designs from many kit manufacturers. These tend to lean more towards orangery or conservatory-type structures but will add a great sense of elegance to your garden office design.\nDo You Need Planning Permission to Build a Garden Office?\nMost garden offices won’t require planning consent, as provided they’re at the rear of the property they’ll generally fall under permitted development (PD) rights. “Projects that can be achieved under PD will broadly speaking be a single-storey building with a maximum roof ridge height of 4m,” says Richard Keys, founding director of ByOthers Studio.\nFinished in Shou Sugi Ban charred timber cladding and constructed with SIPs, SilverLeaf Garden Rooms’ Natur Noir range is customisable with your choice of slimline aluminium bifold doors, windows or timber flooring, making a perfect option for your new garden office\nThe limits are stricter if the garden room is going to be close to a boundary. You’ll also need to consider the use of the building; anything that’s going to act as primary accommodation will require further applications, while features such as verandas don’t count as permitted development.\nIf you’re planning to use your garden office as a primary workplace for a business then you’ll need to consult your local planning authority, too. Holding meetings, having staff come and go, and using the garden office for frequent activity that may cause disturbance through noise or excessive parking will make an impact on whether or not your garden office will receive planning consent.\nPD rights are restricted for listed properties and those in designated areas, such as national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty. If you’re able to build your garden office under permitted development, it’ll be wise to consider a Lawful Development Certificate as this proves the work was permitted and will come in handy should you choose to sell your home.\nCLOSER LOOK Getting power to your garden office\nMost garden offices will require a power supply – whether that’s for a computer, lighting or electric underfloor heating. Varying needs will call for different installations, though, so before diving into a project, discuss with those who will use the space what your requirements are.\nHow can I get electricity to a garden office? \nIn most cases, an electrician can tap into your home’s consumer unit, providing it’s recently installed and up to standard. The power is then run through armoured cables along a fence or underground, which will depend on the buildings’ distance from one another. However, if you’re planning to include underfloor heating, electric showers or cookers, additional upgrades may be required. “A site survey is best for this element to confirm what work is required and the costs involved,” recommends Matthew Farrington.\nGoing off-grid can also prove a great, eco-friendly option, which is something to consider if you’re building your garden room a fair distance from the main house. “If you’re only needing a small supply, you may be able to look into installing a solar panel-charged battery pack for lighting and power,” says Richard Keys.\nWho should do these works? \nMost garden building suppliers will have qualified professionals on-hand, or you can source your own electrician locally. “Electrical installations in garden buildings will require certification to show that they comply with building and electrical safety regulations. A qualified electrician should provide a Part Q certificate to confirm that the work has been properly completed,” says Matthew.\nWhat should I budget when building my garden office? \nThe exact cost of electrical works for a garden office depends on a range of factors, from the age of the consumer unit to the distance between supplies and the level of groundworks needed.

              "text": "How to build a garden office\nThere has never been a better time to work from home. Flexible working hours and the growth in new small businesses means that there is an increasing workforce ready to do just that and what nicer place than from a garden office or studio. Below are some tips on how to build your garden office, but don't forget to talk to your builder or planning council before starting anything.\nThe garden office is a prime location in which to work from home and there are many advantages to this option. Carving an office out of existing accommodation can be difficult, as there are so many competing pressures on space. In addition, many self-employed people find that they need to break away from the domestic environment where there are distractions – the journey to work, albeit a stroll down the garden path, is an essential commute that keeps home life and work separate.\nCareful planning\nIn general, most buildings provided by specialist home office suppliers will comply with, or be exempt from, planning permission. This relates to the volume of the building and to its overall height. Any garden office should not occupy an area more than 50 per cent of the garden space, with heights limited to 3m for a flat roof and 4m for a ridged roof. Structures should not be positioned between the house and the road and normally a distance of 20m from the road is applied. Any structures that do not comply with these basic rules will require planning permission. Regulations should be checked here. \nFor gardens within conservation areas, no garden office can be erected with a volume exceeding 10m3 without specific planning permission. This can be limiting, but informal discussions with local planners should prove supportive. Gardens within Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks will have similar limitations and the rules will need to be researched. Gardens associated with listed buildings will have specific constraints, often in the form of a ‘curtilage’. This relates to an ill-defined space around the building in which little or nothing can be built. Again, discussions with the local planning office prior to developing plans will help.\nFrom shed to office\nFor an effective garden office you will need to consider insulation as this will help to control temperatures across the seasons and prevent or reduce the effects of condensation. Essentially, this is what separates the garden office from the garden shed.\nYou may also need sound insulation, dependent upon your intended use. Double glazing, heating, lighting and mains connections for water and electricity increase the comfort levels and all-year-round usability. Many of the companies supplying the garden office structure will provide such services as part of the package, with some even negotiating with the planning department on your behalf. This provides a comfortable and basic office to which can be added a bathroom, shower room or sauna, creating a space flexible enough for overspill guest accommodation.\nLight & safety\nSecurity is a major issue as garden offices are an easy target for burglars, often built at some distance from the house and out of earshot. Door and window locks, together with an alarm system linked to the house, are all-important considerations. Consider orientation too, related to where in the office you will work. North-facing light is good as it avoids or minimises direct sunlight, or alternatively consider roof overhangs or veranda structures to reduce summer glare.\nThe garden office structures themselves are usually timber, coming in prefabricated panels to be built on site. Some are factory built and craned into position. They need a level surface and sit on concrete piles to minimise direct contact with the ground, with the building itself supported by a steel frame. Roof structures can be customised to take planting.\nMake a connection\nIf you are lucky enough to own convertible outbuildings, the main consideration would be internal fitting, servicing and insulation. Advice on such conversions would be best from local architects, who would also be of help with planning issues. Staining can reduce the impact of the building, especially using darker colours, or link the building into other structures within the garden such as pergolas or arbours. Good supporting structural planting can also help to settle the new building into its location, as this will soften its outline and silhouette.\nFor the connection between the garden and garden office, decks are popular and appropriate as they deal with the raised level of the internal floor and suit the external timber finishes. The provision of an outdoor seating space outside the garden office makes the location within the garden much more tantalising, combined with French or sliding glass doors to open the office space to the garden in warmer weather.\nSize the external paved area according to your anticipated use – perhaps just three or four square metres if you are to work alone, 10-20 square metres if you expect to work with colleagues, or to bring your clients into the garden.\nThis expanded use can also impact on the wider garden and the means of access for you and your visitors. Consider pathway widths with 1.2m a recommended minimum, and how access to the garden gate or house is to be arranged.\nAs with any garden venture, it is important to take a wider view in order to optimise your investment as garden offices increasingly become bigger and bigger business.\nKEY POINTS TO TAKE AWAY\nMake comparisons between the various garden office companies, unless you intend to design and build yourself.

It allows you to design a space that reflects your personal style and meets your specific needs, all while potentially saving money. In this guide, we'll explore what self build housing is, the benefits it brings, the challenges you might face, and essential tips for getting started.\\n\\n## What is Self Build Housing?\\n\\nSelf build housing is the process of creating your own home, either by doing the construction yourself or hiring contractors to assist. This approach allows homeowners to have a say in every aspect of their home, from the layout to the materials used. According to **Wikipedia**, self-build projects can range from simple DIY tasks to comprehensive projects where the homeowner takes on the role of project manager (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-build)).\\n\\n### Key Features of Self Build Housing:\\n- **Customization**: Tailor every aspect to fit your lifestyle and preferences.\\n- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Potentially lower costs compared to buying a pre-built home.\\n- **Personal Satisfaction**: A sense of accomplishment in creating your own space.\\n\\n## Benefits of Self Build Housing\\n\\nThe appeal of self build housing extends beyond just saving money. Here are some **key benefits**:\\n\\n1. **Design Freedom**: You have the creative control to design a home that perfectly fits your needs.\\n2. **Sustainability Options**: Many self-builders incorporate eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient systems.\\n3. **Community Building**: Engaging in a self build project can foster relationships with neighbors and other builders.\\n4. **Investment Value**: A well-executed self-build home can appreciate significantly in value.\\n\\nAccording to the **National Custom & Self Build Association**, self build projects contributed significantly to the housing market, with **37,000 homes** supported in the last financial year (source: [NaCSBA](https://nacsba.org.uk/nacsba-news-archive/self-build-statistics/)).\\n\\n## Challenges of Self Build Housing\\n\\nWhile the benefits are enticing, self building also comes with its own set of challenges:\\n\\n- **Time Commitment**: Building a home can be time-consuming, requiring significant planning and management.\\n- **Skill Requirements**: Depending on how much you plan to do yourself, some construction skills may be necessary.\\n- **Budget Overruns**: It’s easy to underestimate costs, so having a detailed budget and contingency plan is essential.\\n- **Regulatory Hurdles**: Navigating local building codes and regulations can be complex.\\n\\n### Pro Tip:\\nConsider starting small. Many first-time self builders begin with an extension or a smaller project to gain experience before tackling a full home build.\\n\\n## Getting Started with Your Self Build Project\\n\\nHere are some **essential steps** to kick off your self build journey:\\n\\n1. **Research**: Understand the self build process. Look into local regulations, financing options, and available plots.\\n2. **Create a Budget**: Determine how much you can afford to spend and include a buffer for unexpected costs.\\n3. **Choose Your Design**: Decide on a design that meets your needs. You can opt for a custom design or modify an existing plan.\\n4. **Gather Your Team**: If needed, hire professionals like architects or builders who align with your vision.\\n5. **Secure Permits**: Ensure all necessary permits are obtained before breaking ground.\\n\\n## The Future of Self Build Housing\\n\\nThe self build housing trend is gaining traction, particularly in regions facing housing shortages. In the UK, for example, **three-quarters** of all new homes are built by developers, but demand for self build options is increasing (source: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Percentage-of-new-homes-which-are-self-build-homes-in-different-countries-Data-Source_fig1_45267066)). This shift illustrates a growing desire for personalized and sustainable living spaces.\\n\\n### Why Now?\\n- **Market Demand**: Increased interest in affordable housing options.\\n- **Technological Advances**: New building materials and methods make self-building more accessible.\\n- **Community Initiatives**: Local governments are increasingly supportive of self-build projects.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nSelf build housing represents an exciting opportunity to create a home that truly reflects your personality and lifestyle. While there are challenges to navigate, the rewards—both financial and personal—are well worth the effort. If you're ready to take the plunge, start researching and planning your project today!\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Meta Description**: Explore self build housing—discover benefits, challenges, and tips to create your dream home with our comprehensive guide.\\n\\n**Keywords**: self build housing, benefits of self build, challenges of self build\\n\\n**Sources**:\\n1.

It allows you to design a space that reflects your personal style and meets your specific needs, all while potentially saving money. In this guide, we'll explore what self build housing is, the benefits it brings, the challenges you might face, and essential tips for getting started.\n\n## What is Self Build Housing?\n\nSelf build housing is the process of creating your own home, either by doing the construction yourself or hiring contractors to assist. This approach allows homeowners to have a say in every aspect of their home, from the layout to the materials used. According to **Wikipedia**, self-build projects can range from simple DIY tasks to comprehensive projects where the homeowner takes on the role of project manager (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-build)).\n\n### Key Features of Self Build Housing:\n- **Customization**: Tailor every aspect to fit your lifestyle and preferences.\n- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Potentially lower costs compared to buying a pre-built home.\n- **Personal Satisfaction**: A sense of accomplishment in creating your own space.\n\n## Benefits of Self Build Housing\n\nThe appeal of self build housing extends beyond just saving money. Here are some **key benefits**:\n\n1. **Design Freedom**: You have the creative control to design a home that perfectly fits your needs.\n2. **Sustainability Options**: Many self-builders incorporate eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient systems.\n3. **Community Building**: Engaging in a self build project can foster relationships with neighbors and other builders.\n4. **Investment Value**: A well-executed self-build home can appreciate significantly in value.\n\nAccording to the **National Custom & Self Build Association**, self build projects contributed significantly to the housing market, with **37,000 homes** supported in the last financial year (source: [NaCSBA](https://nacsba.org.uk/nacsba-news-archive/self-build-statistics/)).\n\n## Challenges of Self Build Housing\n\nWhile the benefits are enticing, self building also comes with its own set of challenges:\n\n- **Time Commitment**: Building a home can be time-consuming, requiring significant planning and management.\n- **Skill Requirements**: Depending on how much you plan to do yourself, some construction skills may be necessary.\n- **Budget Overruns**: It’s easy to underestimate costs, so having a detailed budget and contingency plan is essential.\n- **Regulatory Hurdles**: Navigating local building codes and regulations can be complex.\n\n### Pro Tip:\nConsider starting small. Many first-time self builders begin with an extension or a smaller project to gain experience before tackling a full home build.\n\n## Getting Started with Your Self Build Project\n\nHere are some **essential steps** to kick off your self build journey:\n\n1. **Research**: Understand the self build process. Look into local regulations, financing options, and available plots.\n2. **Create a Budget**: Determine how much you can afford to spend and include a buffer for unexpected costs.\n3. **Choose Your Design**: Decide on a design that meets your needs. You can opt for a custom design or modify an existing plan.\n4. **Gather Your Team**: If needed, hire professionals like architects or builders who align with your vision.\n5. **Secure Permits**: Ensure all necessary permits are obtained before breaking ground.\n\n## The Future of Self Build Housing\n\nThe self build housing trend is gaining traction, particularly in regions facing housing shortages. In the UK, for example, **three-quarters** of all new homes are built by developers, but demand for self build options is increasing (source: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Percentage-of-new-homes-which-are-self-build-homes-in-different-countries-Data-Source_fig1_45267066)). This shift illustrates a growing desire for personalized and sustainable living spaces.\n\n### Why Now?\n- **Market Demand**: Increased interest in affordable housing options.\n- **Technological Advances**: New building materials and methods make self-building more accessible.\n- **Community Initiatives**: Local governments are increasingly supportive of self-build projects.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSelf build housing represents an exciting opportunity to create a home that truly reflects your personality and lifestyle. While there are challenges to navigate, the rewards—both financial and personal—are well worth the effort. If you're ready to take the plunge, start researching and planning your project today!\n\n---\n\n**Meta Description**: Explore self build housing—discover benefits, challenges, and tips to create your dream home with our comprehensive guide.\n\n**Keywords**: self build housing, benefits of self build, challenges of self build\n\n**Sources**:\n1.

      "output": "# Understanding Tests: Definitions, Types, and Applications\n\n## Introduction\nThe term \"test\" encompasses a broad array of meanings across various fields, including education, psychology, and general assessment. At its core, a test is a means of evaluating knowledge, skills, or characteristics. This article delves into the definitions of tests, explores different types of tests, and discusses their applications in psychology and education.\n\n## What is a Test?\nA test can be defined as an assessment tool used to measure knowledge, skills, or abilities. According to Merriam-Webster, a test is \"something (such as a series of questions or exercises) for measuring the skill, knowledge, intelligence, capacities, or aptitudes of an individual or group\" ([Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/test)). The term can also refer to any situation or challenge that assesses a person's capabilities or performance.\n\n### Types of Tests\nTests can be categorized in various ways:\n\n1. **Standardized Tests**: These are tests administered and scored in a consistent manner, designed to compare the performance of different individuals. They are commonly used in educational settings to evaluate student learning ([Wikipedia on Standardized Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test)).\n\n2. **Formative and Summative Assessments**: Formative assessments occur during the learning process to monitor student learning and provide ongoing feedback. Summative assessments, on the other hand, evaluate student learning at the end of an instructional unit by comparing it against some standard or benchmark ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/testing-in-education)).\n\n3. **Diagnostic Tests**: These tests identify a learner’s strengths and weaknesses, allowing educators to tailor instruction to individual needs ([Talimenam Blog](https://talimenam.blogspot.com/2014/12/what-is-test-how-many-types-of-test-are.html)).\n\n4. **Performance-Based Tests**: These tests require students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills through practical applications. Examples include lab experiments in science or writing essays in literature classes.\n\n## Tests in Psychology\nIn the field of psychology, tests are crucial for assessing mental health, personality traits, and cognitive abilities. Psychological testing involves standardized procedures designed to obtain a representative sample of behavior under specific conditions. These tests can provide insights into a person's mental health status, cognitive functioning, and personality characteristics ([NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK305233/)). \n\n### Types of Psychological Tests\n1. **Personality Tests**: These tests assess individual personality traits and can help in understanding behaviors and preferences. Common examples include the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and the Big Five personality traits assessment ([Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/tests)).\n\n2. **Cognitive Ability Tests**: These tests measure intellectual capabilities, such as reasoning, problem-solving, and comprehension. Examples include IQ tests and other standardized intelligence assessments.\n\n3. **Diagnostic Tests**: Used primarily in clinical settings, these tests help diagnose mental health conditions, guiding treatment plans ([APA on Testing](https://www.apa.org/topics/testing-assessment-measurement)).\n\n## Tests in Education\nTesting plays a pivotal role in education, serving as a primary method for evaluating student learning and progress. According to a report on testing in education, tests yield measurements of a student's abilities through different formats, such as multiple-choice questions or essays ([EBSCO Research](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/education/testing-and-evaluationtesting-and-evaluation)).\n\n### Key Characteristics of Educational Tests\n1. **Validity and Reliability**: A good test must accurately measure what it is intended to measure (validity) and produce consistent results over time (reliability).\n\n2. **Fairness**: Tests should be designed to be free from bias, ensuring that they are fair for all students regardless of their background.\n\n3. **Alignment with Learning Objectives**: Effective tests are closely aligned with the educational goals and objectives they aim to assess, ensuring that they measure relevant knowledge and skills ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/testing-in-education)).\n\n## Conclusion\nTests serve as a fundamental tool in various domains, from education to psychology, providing critical data that informs decisions about learning and mental health. Understanding the different types of tests and their applications is essential for educators, psychologists, and individuals alike. As assessment methods continue to evolve, the importance of developing fair and effective testing practices remains paramount. \n\nFor further insights and detailed discussions on tests, refer to the following sources:\n- [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/test)\n- [Wikipedia on Standardized Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test)\n- [NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK305233/)\n- [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/testing-in-education)\n- [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/tests)\n\n---\n[📥 Download Understanding Tests: Definitions, Types, and Applications](/skill-pdfs/understanding_tests_1771621258594_oh4yfg.pdf)",

            "content": "# Understanding Tests: Definitions, Types, and Applications\n\n## Introduction\nThe term \"test\" encompasses a broad array of meanings across various fields, including education, psychology, and general assessment. At its core, a test is a means of evaluating knowledge, skills, or characteristics. This article delves into the definitions of tests, explores different types of tests, and discusses their applications in psychology and education.\n\n## What is a Test?\nA test can be defined as an assessment tool used to measure knowledge, skills, or abilities. According to Merriam-Webster, a test is \"something (such as a series of questions or exercises) for measuring the skill, knowledge, intelligence, capacities, or aptitudes of an individual or group\" ([Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/test)). The term can also refer to any situation or challenge that assesses a person's capabilities or performance.\n\n### Types of Tests\nTests can be categorized in various ways:\n\n1. **Standardized Tests**: These are tests administered and scored in a consistent manner, designed to compare the performance of different individuals. They are commonly used in educational settings to evaluate student learning ([Wikipedia on Standardized Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test)).\n\n2. **Formative and Summative Assessments**: Formative assessments occur during the learning process to monitor student learning and provide ongoing feedback. Summative assessments, on the other hand, evaluate student learning at the end of an instructional unit by comparing it against some standard or benchmark ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/testing-in-education)).\n\n3. **Diagnostic Tests**: These tests identify a learner’s strengths and weaknesses, allowing educators to tailor instruction to individual needs ([Talimenam Blog](https://talimenam.blogspot.com/2014/12/what-is-test-how-many-types-of-test-are.html)).\n\n4. **Performance-Based Tests**: These tests require students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills through practical applications. Examples include lab experiments in science or writing essays in literature classes.\n\n## Tests in Psychology\nIn the field of psychology, tests are crucial for assessing mental health, personality traits, and cognitive abilities. Psychological testing involves standardized procedures designed to obtain a representative sample of behavior under specific conditions. These tests can provide insights into a person's mental health status, cognitive functioning, and personality characteristics ([NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK305233/)). \n\n### Types of Psychological Tests\n1. **Personality Tests**: These tests assess individual personality traits and can help in understanding behaviors and preferences. Common examples include the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and the Big Five personality traits assessment ([Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/tests)).\n\n2. **Cognitive Ability Tests**: These tests measure intellectual capabilities, such as reasoning, problem-solving, and comprehension. Examples include IQ tests and other standardized intelligence assessments.\n\n3. **Diagnostic Tests**: Used primarily in clinical settings, these tests help diagnose mental health conditions, guiding treatment plans ([APA on Testing](https://www.apa.org/topics/testing-assessment-measurement)).\n\n## Tests in Education\nTesting plays a pivotal role in education, serving as a primary method for evaluating student learning and progress. According to a report on testing in education, tests yield measurements of a student's abilities through different formats, such as multiple-choice questions or essays ([EBSCO Research](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/education/testing-and-evaluationtesting-and-evaluation)).\n\n### Key Characteristics of Educational Tests\n1. **Validity and Reliability**: A good test must accurately measure what it is intended to measure (validity) and produce consistent results over time (reliability).\n\n2. **Fairness**: Tests should be designed to be free from bias, ensuring that they are fair for all students regardless of their background.\n\n3. **Alignment with Learning Objectives**: Effective tests are closely aligned with the educational goals and objectives they aim to assess, ensuring that they measure relevant knowledge and skills ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/testing-in-education)).\n\n## Conclusion\nTests serve as a fundamental tool in various domains, from education to psychology, providing critical data that informs decisions about learning and mental health. Understanding the different types of tests and their applications is essential for educators, psychologists, and individuals alike. As assessment methods continue to evolve, the importance of developing fair and effective testing practices remains paramount. \n\nFor further insights and detailed discussions on tests, refer to the following sources:\n- [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/test)\n- [Wikipedia on Standardized Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test)\n- [NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK305233/)\n- [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/testing-in-education)\n- [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/tests)",

      "output": "# The Significance of \"Hello World\" in Programming\n\n## Introduction\n\"Hello, World!\" is a phrase that has transcended its simple meaning to become a symbol of programming and software development. Often the first program written by novices when learning a new programming language, this phrase represents a rite of passage for aspiring coders. This article explores the history, significance, and cultural impact of \"Hello, World!\" in the programming world.\n\n## The Origins of \"Hello, World!\"\nThe phrase \"Hello, World!\" is widely believed to have originated from the book *The C Programming Language*, authored by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie in 1978. In this seminal text, a simple program was provided that displayed the phrase on the screen, marking its introduction to the programming lexicon ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)).\n\nHowever, its roots may trace back even further to the programming language BCPL, which existed in 1967. The use of \"Hello, World!\" as a test message in programming likely began with small test programs used by early computer scientists ([HackerRank Blog](https://www.hackerrank.com/blog/the-history-of-hello-world/)).\n\n## Why \"Hello, World!\"?\nThe simplicity of the \"Hello, World!\" program makes it an ideal first step for beginners. It typically consists of just a few lines of code, allowing newcomers to focus on understanding the syntax of a new programming language without the complexities of more elaborate coding tasks. As noted in various programming resources, the program serves as a gentle introduction to coding that helps build foundational skills ([Tuple](https://www.tuple.nl/en/blog/hello-world-exploring-programming-s-iconic-phrase)).\n\nAdditionally, it instills a sense of accomplishment. For many, seeing the phrase displayed on the screen signifies the successful execution of their very first program, which can be a motivating experience for budding programmers ([CodeInterview Blog](https://codeinterview.io/blog/the-history-of-hello-world-a-brief-overview/)).\n\n## Cultural Impact and Community Engagement\nBeyond its educational significance, \"Hello, World!\" has become a cultural phenomenon within the programming community. It is often referenced in discussions about programming, symbolizing the beginning of a programmer's journey. Online forums, such as Reddit, feature discussions that dive into the emotional and psychological aspects of writing the first \"Hello, World!\" program, emphasizing its importance as a personal milestone in the coding world ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/fnhja2/why_do_all_programming_languages_start_with_hello/)).\n\nFurthermore, the phrase has been embraced by various coding initiatives, such as Code.org's \"Hour of Code,\" which aims to introduce computer science to students through simple exercises, starting with \"Hello, World!\" ([Code.org](https://code.org/en-US/hour-of-code/helloworld)).\n\n## Variations Across Programming Languages\nWhile the basic concept remains the same, the implementation of \"Hello, World!\" varies across programming languages. For instance, in Python, it can be executed with a single line of code:\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\nIn contrast, a \"Hello, World!\" program in C requires slightly more complexity:\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    printf(\"Hello, World!\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThese variations highlight the unique syntax and features of each language, making \"Hello, World!\" not only a learning tool but also a showcase of programming diversity ([GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c/c-hello-world-program/)).\n\n## The Continued Relevance of \"Hello, World!\"\nAs technology evolves, the relevance of \"Hello, World!\" persists. It continues to be an integral part of coding tutorials, programming courses, and boot camps worldwide. The phrase symbolizes the entry point into the vast and dynamic world of programming, reminding generations of developers of their first steps in coding ([Medium](https://akkologlu.medium.com/hello-world-the-story-of-the-legendary-first-step-in-programming-bb06a623f7f7)).\n\n## Conclusion\n\"Hello, World!\" is more than just a simple phrase; it is a fundamental part of the programming culture and education. Its historical roots, combined with its significance in the learning process, make it a powerful symbol of both the challenges and joys of coding. As future generations of programmers continue to embrace this tradition, \"Hello, World!\" will undoubtedly remain a staple in the landscape of computer science.\n\nFor more information, you can explore the following sources:\n- [Wikipedia on Hello, World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)\n- [HackerRank Blog](https://www.hackerrank.com/blog/the-history-of-hello-world/)\n- [Tuple's Exploration of the Phrase](https://www.tuple.nl/en/blog/hello-world-exploring-programming-s-iconic-phrase)\n- [Code.org's Hour of Code](https://code.org/en-US/hour-of-code/helloworld)\n- [Medium Article](https://akkologlu.medium.com/hello-world-the-story-of-the-legendary-first-step-in-programming-bb06a623f7f7)\n\n---\n[📥 Download The Significance of \"Hello World\" in Programming](/skill-pdfs/hello_world_significance_1771621452260_8htvtj.pdf)",

            "content": "# The Significance of \"Hello World\" in Programming\n\n## Introduction\n\"Hello, World!\" is a phrase that has transcended its simple meaning to become a symbol of programming and software development. Often the first program written by novices when learning a new programming language, this phrase represents a rite of passage for aspiring coders. This article explores the history, significance, and cultural impact of \"Hello, World!\" in the programming world.\n\n## The Origins of \"Hello, World!\"\nThe phrase \"Hello, World!\" is widely believed to have originated from the book *The C Programming Language*, authored by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie in 1978. In this seminal text, a simple program was provided that displayed the phrase on the screen, marking its introduction to the programming lexicon ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)).\n\nHowever, its roots may trace back even further to the programming language BCPL, which existed in 1967. The use of \"Hello, World!\" as a test message in programming likely began with small test programs used by early computer scientists ([HackerRank Blog](https://www.hackerrank.com/blog/the-history-of-hello-world/)).\n\n## Why \"Hello, World!\"?\nThe simplicity of the \"Hello, World!\" program makes it an ideal first step for beginners. It typically consists of just a few lines of code, allowing newcomers to focus on understanding the syntax of a new programming language without the complexities of more elaborate coding tasks. As noted in various programming resources, the program serves as a gentle introduction to coding that helps build foundational skills ([Tuple](https://www.tuple.nl/en/blog/hello-world-exploring-programming-s-iconic-phrase)).\n\nAdditionally, it instills a sense of accomplishment. For many, seeing the phrase displayed on the screen signifies the successful execution of their very first program, which can be a motivating experience for budding programmers ([CodeInterview Blog](https://codeinterview.io/blog/the-history-of-hello-world-a-brief-overview/)).\n\n## Cultural Impact and Community Engagement\nBeyond its educational significance, \"Hello, World!\" has become a cultural phenomenon within the programming community. It is often referenced in discussions about programming, symbolizing the beginning of a programmer's journey. Online forums, such as Reddit, feature discussions that dive into the emotional and psychological aspects of writing the first \"Hello, World!\" program, emphasizing its importance as a personal milestone in the coding world ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/fnhja2/why_do_all_programming_languages_start_with_hello/)).\n\nFurthermore, the phrase has been embraced by various coding initiatives, such as Code.org's \"Hour of Code,\" which aims to introduce computer science to students through simple exercises, starting with \"Hello, World!\" ([Code.org](https://code.org/en-US/hour-of-code/helloworld)).\n\n## Variations Across Programming Languages\nWhile the basic concept remains the same, the implementation of \"Hello, World!\" varies across programming languages. For instance, in Python, it can be executed with a single line of code:\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\nIn contrast, a \"Hello, World!\" program in C requires slightly more complexity:\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    printf(\"Hello, World!\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThese variations highlight the unique syntax and features of each language, making \"Hello, World!\" not only a learning tool but also a showcase of programming diversity ([GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c/c-hello-world-program/)).\n\n## The Continued Relevance of \"Hello, World!\"\nAs technology evolves, the relevance of \"Hello, World!\" persists. It continues to be an integral part of coding tutorials, programming courses, and boot camps worldwide. The phrase symbolizes the entry point into the vast and dynamic world of programming, reminding generations of developers of their first steps in coding ([Medium](https://akkologlu.medium.com/hello-world-the-story-of-the-legendary-first-step-in-programming-bb06a623f7f7)).\n\n## Conclusion\n\"Hello, World!\" is more than just a simple phrase; it is a fundamental part of the programming culture and education. Its historical roots, combined with its significance in the learning process, make it a powerful symbol of both the challenges and joys of coding. As future generations of programmers continue to embrace this tradition, \"Hello, World!\" will undoubtedly remain a staple in the landscape of computer science.\n\nFor more information, you can explore the following sources:\n- [Wikipedia on Hello, World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)\n- [HackerRank Blog](https://www.hackerrank.com/blog/the-history-of-hello-world/)\n- [Tuple's Exploration of the Phrase](https://www.tuple.nl/en/blog/hello-world-exploring-programming-s-iconic-phrase)\n- [Code.org's Hour of Code](https://code.org/en-US/hour-of-code/helloworld)\n- [Medium Article](https://akkologlu.medium.com/hello-world-the-story-of-the-legendary-first-step-in-programming-bb06a623f7f7)",

Build your dream home today!\n\n## Introduction\n\nBuilding your own home might sound like a daunting task, but self build housing offers a unique opportunity to create a space that reflects your personality and meets your specific needs. Whether you're looking to save money, customize your living environment, or simply enjoy the satisfaction of doing it yourself, self building can be a rewarding experience. \n\nIn this guide, we will explore the world of self build housing, covering the various methods available, the benefits and challenges you may face, and expert tips to help you navigate the process. From financing options to sustainable building practices, you'll find everything you need to know to embark on your self build journey.\n\n## Understanding Self Build Housing\n\n### What is Self Build Housing?\n\nSelf build housing is the process of individuals or groups constructing their own homes. This can range from doing everything yourself (DIY) to hiring contractors for specific tasks while managing the project. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-build), self-build projects can encompass a variety of methods, including traditional building, modular homes, and even eco-friendly options like earthships.\n\n#### Key Types of Self Build Housing:\n\n- **DIY Self Build**: The owner is involved in the construction process.\n- **Contractor Assisted Build**: The owner manages the project while contractors perform the work.\n- **Kit Homes**: Pre-designed homes that come with all materials needed for assembly.\n\n### Why Choose Self Build Housing?\n\nThere are several reasons why homeowners opt for self build projects:\n\n- **Cost Savings**: Self building can often be cheaper than buying a pre-built home.\n- **Customization**: Tailor your home to fit your lifestyle and preferences.\n- **Sustainability**: Choose eco-friendly materials and design features to reduce your environmental impact.\n\n### Statistics on Self Build Housing\n\nRecent studies show that self build housing is becoming increasingly popular. In the UK, for example, it’s estimated that around **15%** of new homes are self-built, according to research by the National Custom & Self Build Association. Additionally, in countries like Ghana, self-build housing contributes significantly to the local economy, supplying more than **95%** of the total housing stock ([World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org)).\n\n## Planning Your Self Build Project\n\n### Key Steps in the Planning Process\n\n1. **Research and Design**: Start by researching different styles and designs that suit your needs. Tools like [House Plans](https://www.houseplans.com/) can provide inspiration.\n   \n2. **Budgeting**: Determine how much you can afford to spend. Consider land costs, materials, labor, and permits. \n\n3. **Securing Financing**: Look into self build mortgages, which can be tailored to support construction projects. Check with local banks and financial institutions.\n\n4. **Choosing a Location**: The location of your self build can greatly influence its success. Research local zoning laws and land availability.\n\n### Expert Tips for Successful Planning\n\n- **Engage with the Community**: Connect with other self builders on platforms like [Reddit’s Homebuilding](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebuilding/) to share experiences and tips.\n  \n- **Hire Professionals**: While self building can be DIY, hiring an architect or builder can ensure your project meets all regulations and standards.\n\n## Construction Phase\n\n### Materials and Techniques\n\nChoosing the right materials is crucial. Here are some popular options for self build housing:\n\n- **Timber Frames**: Lightweight and sustainable, timber frames are a common choice for self builders.\n- **Modular Kits**: These homes come with pre-cut materials and are designed for ease of assembly.\n- **Eco-friendly Materials**: Consider using recycled materials or sustainable options like straw bales or rammed earth.\n\n### Managing the Construction Process\n\n- **Project Management**: If you're acting as your own project manager, create a detailed timeline to keep the project on track.\n  \n- **Permitting and Inspections**: Ensure you have all necessary permits before starting construction. Regular inspections can help identify issues early.\n\n## Sustainability in Self Build Housing\n\n### Eco-Friendly Practices\n\nSustainability is a growing concern in the housing market, and self builders have the unique opportunity to incorporate green practices into their projects. Here are some ideas:\n\n- **Solar Panels**: Installing solar panels can greatly reduce energy costs.\n- **Green Roofs**: These provide insulation and help manage stormwater.\n- **Sustainable Materials**: Use locally sourced or recycled materials to minimize your carbon footprint.\n\n### Benefits of Sustainable Self Build Housing\n\n- **Lower Utility Bills**: Energy-efficient homes save money in the long run.\n- **Increased Property Value**: Eco-friendly homes are often more appealing to buyers.\n- **Positive Environmental Impact**: Sustainable building practices contribute to a healthier planet.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSelf build housing offers a unique opportunity to create a home that’s tailored to your needs while providing potential cost savings and personal satisfaction. By understanding the planning and construction processes, and embracing sustainable practices, you can turn your dream home into a reality. \n\nReady to start your self build journey?

Anyway, self-built accommodation became the most common form of housing and, in Mexico City area, it increased from 14% in 1952 to 60% in 1990.

Build your dream home today!\n\n## Introduction\n\nBuilding your own home might sound like a daunting task, but self build housing offers a unique opportunity to create a space that reflects your personality and meets your specific needs. Whether you're looking to save money, customize your living environment, or simply enjoy the satisfaction of doing it yourself, self building can be a rewarding experience. \n\nIn this guide, we will explore the world of self build housing, covering the various methods available, the benefits and challenges you may face, and expert tips to help you navigate the process. From financing options to sustainable building practices, you'll find everything you need to know to embark on your self build journey.\n\n## Understanding Self Build Housing\n\n### What is Self Build Housing?\n\nSelf build housing is the process of individuals or groups constructing their own homes. This can range from doing everything yourself (DIY) to hiring contractors for specific tasks while managing the project. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-build), self-build projects can encompass a variety of methods, including traditional building, modular homes, and even eco-friendly options like earthships.\n\n#### Key Types of Self Build Housing:\n\n- **DIY Self Build**: The owner is involved in the construction process.\n- **Contractor Assisted Build**: The owner manages the project while contractors perform the work.\n- **Kit Homes**: Pre-designed homes that come with all materials needed for assembly.\n\n### Why Choose Self Build Housing?\n\nThere are several reasons why homeowners opt for self build projects:\n\n- **Cost Savings**: Self building can often be cheaper than buying a pre-built home.\n- **Customization**: Tailor your home to fit your lifestyle and preferences.\n- **Sustainability**: Choose eco-friendly materials and design features to reduce your environmental impact.\n\n### Statistics on Self Build Housing\n\nRecent studies show that self build housing is becoming increasingly popular. In the UK, for example, it’s estimated that around **15%** of new homes are self-built, according to research by the National Custom & Self Build Association. Additionally, in countries like Ghana, self-build housing contributes significantly to the local economy, supplying more than **95%** of the total housing stock ([World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org)).\n\n## Planning Your Self Build Project\n\n### Key Steps in the Planning Process\n\n1. **Research and Design**: Start by researching different styles and designs that suit your needs. Tools like [House Plans](https://www.houseplans.com/) can provide inspiration.\n   \n2. **Budgeting**: Determine how much you can afford to spend. Consider land costs, materials, labor, and permits. \n\n3. **Securing Financing**: Look into self build mortgages, which can be tailored to support construction projects. Check with local banks and financial institutions.\n\n4. **Choosing a Location**: The location of your self build can greatly influence its success. Research local zoning laws and land availability.\n\n### Expert Tips for Successful Planning\n\n- **Engage with the Community**: Connect with other self builders on platforms like [Reddit’s Homebuilding](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebuilding/) to share experiences and tips.\n  \n- **Hire Professionals**: While self building can be DIY, hiring an architect or builder can ensure your project meets all regulations and standards.\n\n## Construction Phase\n\n### Materials and Techniques\n\nChoosing the right materials is crucial. Here are some popular options for self build housing:\n\n- **Timber Frames**: Lightweight and sustainable, timber frames are a common choice for self builders.\n- **Modular Kits**: These homes come with pre-cut materials and are designed for ease of assembly.\n- **Eco-friendly Materials**: Consider using recycled materials or sustainable options like straw bales or rammed earth.\n\n### Managing the Construction Process\n\n- **Project Management**: If you're acting as your own project manager, create a detailed timeline to keep the project on track.\n  \n- **Permitting and Inspections**: Ensure you have all necessary permits before starting construction. Regular inspections can help identify issues early.\n\n## Sustainability in Self Build Housing\n\n### Eco-Friendly Practices\n\nSustainability is a growing concern in the housing market, and self builders have the unique opportunity to incorporate green practices into their projects. Here are some ideas:\n\n- **Solar Panels**: Installing solar panels can greatly reduce energy costs.\n- **Green Roofs**: These provide insulation and help manage stormwater.\n- **Sustainable Materials**: Use locally sourced or recycled materials to minimize your carbon footprint.\n\n### Benefits of Sustainable Self Build Housing\n\n- **Lower Utility Bills**: Energy-efficient homes save money in the long run.\n- **Increased Property Value**: Eco-friendly homes are often more appealing to buyers.\n- **Positive Environmental Impact**: Sustainable building practices contribute to a healthier planet.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSelf build housing offers a unique opportunity to create a home that’s tailored to your needs while providing potential cost savings and personal satisfaction. By understanding the planning and construction processes, and embracing sustainable practices, you can turn your dream home into a reality. \n\nReady to start your self build journey?

If you dangle a nymph in front of a trout long enough, it will likely take the bait. If you&#x27;re fishing a river or lake that you&#x27;ve never been on, the easiest way to find out what the trout are eating is by going to the local tackle shop and asking the experts there."

It is evident that AI as applied to science and research has been growing at a significant pace in recent years, with China leading the way, followed by the EU and the US. Indeed, the EU’s performance is found to be highly heterogeneous across its Member States. If current trends persist, the probability of future scientific discoveries being driven primarily by AI applications and tools is set to increase significantly.\nFailure to keep pace with the development and uptake of AI in science poses important challenges for the EU, including the need to address concerns about strategic autonomy, trends in scientific work and the labour market and, more broadly, productivity and growth.\nAuthors: David Arranz, Stefano Bianchini, Valentina Di Girolamo, Julien Ravet",

              "text": "The Top AI Trends Predicted for 2023\nWith AI adoption growing year on year and the emergence of new software and tools, we're excited to see what this year has in store for the AI world. So we thought who better to ask than the leading AI experts from Toyota, Meta, LinkedIn, and Johnson & Johnson, to name a few more, on what they predict will be the key trends to take AI to the next level in 2023. Check out their top 3 trends below:\nVivek Verma\nMid Data Scientist (Innovation)\nToyota Connected North America\nThe first trend is an alternate product to chatGPT which will lead to competition in this space.\nSecondly, an improved version of the current Stable diffusion model v2.0 will mostly be released in 2023.\nThirdly, a new MLOps platform for NLP and NLU might be developed so as to solve business problems in market research and healthcare among others.\nApostol Vassilev\nResearch Team Lead; AI & Cybersecurity Expert\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\nHarnessing the generative power of AI models to create synthetic data to feed into creating better models.\nEnabling a single model to do more. Right now, we have models that tend to specialize for tasks, hundreds of them. Developing multi-task models is building upon the emergent skills of large language models that can do different tasks without having a specific design for any of them. Examples of this is the ability of models trained on multi-modal data (e.g., images and text) to find links between the different data modalities.\nThe progress in vision transformers. They show exciting capabilities by combining self-attention and convolution. The recent progress we witnessed with the generative power of text-to-image systems based on diffusion models provides evidence of this.\nReshma Lal Jagadheesh \nSenior Data Scientist, Enterprise Intelligence, Online\nThe Home Depot\nImproving Natural Language Understanding and asking the right questions to customers to identify what they are looking for.\nMore research areas to improve automation related to Agent Assist.\nBots capable of handling complex multi turn conversations by themselves with less supervision and training.\nFind out more here\nAayush Prakash\nEngineering Manager\nMeta Reality Labs\nI would like to see more developments in synthetic data. Data is the hard problem of AI, and synthetic data is one of the most promising solutions to address this issue. \nGenerative AI with diffusion models where we can create large amounts of unseen content with simple textual cues is another strong development going into 2023. This has already been extended to 3D via Magic3D and DreamFusion. This will unlock many content generation needs in AI, game, entertainment industries. \nNeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) enables realistic 3D representation of real world scenes . This can help unlock the generation of highly realistic 3D worlds at scale in Metaverse.\nKarl Willis \nSenior Research Manager\nAutodesk\nA new architecture to finally replace Transformers and some of their known weaknesses such as dealing with long range dependencies.\nReduced compute costs and the commoditization of training and fine-tuning large models.\nContinued breakthroughs with multi-modal models, especially text-to-3D and text-to-video with higher fidelity and temporal consistency.\nSam Stone\nDirector of Product Management, Pricing & Data\nOpendoor\nIn 2023, I have my eye on generative models, ML Ops, and interpretability. Generative AI is one of the most buzzed-about technologies right now, and for good reason. Large language models (\"LLMs\") like OpenAI's GPT3 have led the way, but generative models are increasingly multi-modal, meaning they accept multiple types of inputs, like images and text, and return different types of output, like a video with text labels. There's an enormous opportunity to help businesses by building specific applications on top of the large, general models.\nSecond, ML Ops is becoming increasingly beneficial for data scientists because it enables them to focus where they excel: on research to build and improve models. It applies to tried-and-true software development practices including automation, testing, and diagnostics across the full model lifecycle. At Opendoor, we’ve adapted the structure and processes for our technical teams to allow and encourage them to pursue ML Ops. \nLastly, I see interpretability gaining momentum across industries. Deep neural networks have become increasingly powerful and widely used, but these models have become harder to introspect. This has motivated ML researchers and engineers to invest in new methods, like interpretability, to understand the \"why\" behind their model outputs. At Opendoor, interpretability is key, as our customers, who are home sellers and buyers, want to understand the “why” behind the prices we provide for homes that we are buying and selling.\nMathew Teoh\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer\nLinkedIn\nIt’s always hard to predict the future. I can’t say that any prediction you see here is accurate, but I imagine that treating all the predictions across this entire blog post as an ensemble model will give you a better answer than random guessing ;)\nReal time ML: shrinking the time gap between model training, feature computation, and the present means that your model predictions better reflect reality.\nHuman in the loop: data is abundant, but high quality, labeled data is not. These labels are typically expensive if they come from human judgement. Determining the best places to allocate human labeling effort will continue to be a problem worth solving.\nEmbedding-based retrieval: ML systems such as Search that depend on a retrieval step usually depend on strict conditions to be met, such as literal term matches. Embedding-based retrieval relaxes this constraint, and let us show better results.\nView the Summit here\nRoopnath Grandhi\nProduct Leader, Entrepreneur, AI Leadership\nJohnson & Johnson\nMore advancements in large language models like ChatGPT will be released and more startups will explore customizing these large language models to different verticals and applications. \nCustom Silicon and chips like AWS Inferentia and Trainium will gain more traction in bringing the cost down for training and inference of large-scale deep learning models and enabling more innovation. \nEthical and Responsible AI will gain more prominence and organizations and businesses will increase investment in these areas.\nRichard Socher\nCEO\nYou.com\nChat Interfaces - Search and chat interfaces that help users find answers or take an action in a conversational way.\nGenerative AI for Images. They will get better and faster and expand into multi-modal outputs. Instead of a single image or a single text, you will have dialogues, videos, sound, and music. Your creativity will no longer be limited by your execution skills of how well you can paint, draw, or sketch; or how well you can play an instrument or sing with your voice. Your creativity will be mostly restricted by your ideas. Your ideas will be able to come to life much more easily which will mean an explosion in creative outputs.\nA good example is the printing press. Yes, the printing press stole the jobs of monks who copied books, but millions more books were created once we didn't have to copy them anymore manually. Likewise, we will see millions more art pieces, songs, books, and poems being created by the people.\nIn some ways it'll take more work to create something truly novel. In the past, you could've created something novel by being inspired or copying someone else's style. That will become so easy that no one will be impressed by your painting like Van Gogh, Matisse or Dalí, and others. It will be much more impressive to come up with new styles and ideas.\nGenerative AI for medicine - it will change protein structures and that might change all of medicine.\nAmey Dharwadker\nMachine Learning Tech Lead\nMeta\nGraph neural networks (GNN): GNNs are a class of AI models that can learn from complex graph",

              "text": "Trends in using AI for marketing: 2023-2024\nWhat AI-based tools and digital marketing techniques should businesses from small to large be considering?\nI’ve been fortunate to be involved in digital marketing for over 25 years now. The opportunities presented by AI recently are the most exciting developments that I have seen in this time, since the early days, where everything from organic search, a website and email marketing seemed a similarly huge opportunity.\nThis range of projections of advancement in AI presented at Technology for Marketing by Implement AI highlights that we are at a relatively early stage of adoption of AI, with the biggest advancements yet to come recently hinted by the rapid adoption of ChatGPT.\nIn this post, I’ll summarize trends in real-world applications of AI and tools to consider in each of these categories of AI that are open to any business from small to large. Some of the hottest marketing applications and trends in AI we’ll cover are in these five categories\nGenerative AI\nAutonomous AI\nCausal AI\nConversational\nPredictive Analytics\nFor each technology, we’ll look at how they can be used in marketing and recommend some of the best free and paid tools to consider. Apart from the techniques and tools, in the last section, I’ll also review the issues of governance and management - What actions should businesses be taking to improve to their use of AI.\nGenerative AI is currently at the peak of interest according to the latest Gartner Hype Cycle on emerging AI technology. This means that in theory, it will soon enter the ‘trough of disillusionment’ and evidence of this is the comments in subreddits such as r/ChatGPT where power users complain of new limitations caused by legal and ethical concerns. There are also recommendations for other ‘Personalized AI’ competitors which I’ll cover below which given the growing popularity of these and specific paid marketing solutions such as Jasper and Writesonic suggest to me that this category is still ‘on the up’.\nOf course, the applications of AI in marketing aren’t new. In 2017 we shared these use-cases for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in marketing\nOur visual shows the wide array of applications for Machine Learning and AI for marketing across the RACE customer lifecycle, all of which can be put in place today.\nNone of the technology is speculative or on the horizon, these are current marketing techniques already being utilized by many successful companies) across our customer lifecycle. You can read more about how to integrate new or existing MarTech into your digital marketing strategy in our 2024 edition of The Future of Digital Marketing Trends guide, which is a free download produced in partnership with Technology for Marketing.\nThe Future of Digital Marketing trends report\nDownload our future of digital marketing report to benchmark your marketing across the 7 pillars of digital marketing and 400+ marketers.\nAccess the Future of Digital Marketing 2025 trends report\nA good place to start to review the latest trends in AI is the latest Gartner Hype Cycles which chart which new technologies are ‘on the rise’ and forecast when they may reach their respective plateaus.\n1. Generative AI\nDevelopments in Generative AI or Gen AI which produces text, visual and video content from prompts has seen many new features introduced into ChatGPT this year, with ChatGPT now being able to listen and respond to audio prompts, read visuals and with DALL-E integrated, create visuals.\nAI image and video generators\nThis move from text to richer content is one of the trends in this category, with AI now even producing video based on audio or transcripts delivered by human-like avatars through tools like Synthesia and HeyGen, in which you can overlay pictures of your team to implement avatars based on real people (think ABBA Voyager)!\nThis year there has been a huge investment in Generative AI, with Microsoft’s investment and collaboration with OpenAI, the obvious example. With Amazon recently betting $4 billion in Anthropic, the developer of Claude we can expect the Amazon re-branded version of Claude to do well in the years ahead.\nFine-tuned Gen AI\nYou'll know that prompting in ChatGPT works best when Prompts are more specific to what you're looking to achieve, so, in marketing, this means the context for the copy or imagery you're looking to create. In our Quick Win on Using AI for Copywriting I explain a Templating approach which is the most efficient way to define your communications goals, target audience, brand, creative and channels. I also explain how to use ChatGPT's relatively new Custom Instructions feature to re-use supplying the context of your brand, products, customers and brand tone of voice.\nWhile Custom Instructions are a huge improvement to tailor ChatGPT copy to a specific business and audience, they are still limited, so there is a trend to other specific tools for marketers building in fine-tuning. One such is Jasper Brand Voice feature which enables you to upload brand style guidelines or other company information such as campaign briefs to tailor the AI's responses.\nTopical Gen AI\nAnother trend within Gen AI, is that we can expect more regular updates to Large Language models which enable us to work with more topical information than the 2021 currently offered by OpenAI GPT-3 and GPT-4. Although OpenAI doesn’t seem to have cracked this problem yet, Google seems to. You can ask Bard for a summary of the main developments in digital marketing in 2023 and it does a decent job - great for seeing what you may have missed. You can even ask it about trends in AI within marketing for 2024, but the results there are generic compared to this article since it can’t extrapolate as well as a human!\nWe can also expect that the release of Google’s new Search Generated Experience (SGE) will dramatically increase use of Generative AI when it goes live, which is expected to happen in 2024. This will give Google users an AI conversational response like Bing AI. It’s currently being tested in the US, India and Japan and although Google is testing many changes to balance usability and monetization through Ads, it seems likely it will launch in 2024. Some SEOs such as Eli Schwartz are forecasting an SEO apocalypse as clickthroughs to sites decline as the AI in the SERP answers the user's query.\nPersonal Gen AI\nFinally, another trend within Generative AI is illustrated by Pi from Inflection (founded by ex-Google Deepmind developer Mustafa Suleyman (CEO)). In 2023 Inflection AI announced $1.3 billion of funding led by current investors, Microsoft, and NVIDIA.\nBilled as a Personal AI, this currently has a more user-friendly conversational style than ChatGPT which can be voice-enabled and some have compared to the AI in the movie: ‘She’. For me, it’s impressive since it provides a genuine conversation where the AI leads to step you through an issue towards solutions. Compare this to ChatGPT where you have to lead with intelligent prompts to get the most from it…\n2. Autonomous AI agents\nThe future of Autonomous AI agents was highlighted in 2023 when AutoGPT was released. Note that this isn’t an official OpenAI release, although much of the superficial commentary on it suggested it was. Rather it involves clever innovation from one developer to add a coding ‘wrapper’ around ChatGPT via the API. So, it's only available to developers who manually install it from the GitHub code repository. However, it has engaged many developers with its potential, becoming the top trending download on Github.\nMicrosoft Jarvis is another example showcasing the potential of autonomous agents. Like AutoGPT it can only be setup by developers downloading code - it’s not a service yet. This article on How to Set Up and Try Microsoft Jarvis / HuggingGPT shows the approach through this visual.\nSo, AutoGPT and Jarvis can connect to and control other web services using APIs and perform actions such as web searching, web forms, and ",

To ride the profitable and beneficial wave of AI adoption, however, having a roadmap is paramount.\nThis article goes into detailed AI adoption statistics and real-world use cases by industry and task. It provides insights into how exactly you can use available AI opportunities and maximize the efficiency of your decision.\nContents \n\nGlobal AI Market Overview\nBusiness Growth Through AI\nCustom AI Models: Accessible and Cost-Effective \nThe Current State of AI Adoption\nAI Adoption Trends Across Key Industries\nPhases And Milestones In The AI Adoption Roadmap\nAI Energy Dilemma\nAnalyzing Job Exposure and Disruption Risks\nAgentic AI\nHow AI Drives Business Transformation\nMain AI Adoption Challenges\nEnter the AI Future with Confidence\nGlobal AI Market Overview\n\nAnalysts project sustained global AI market growth, which is set to surpass $240 billion in total value. AI adoption by the industry is growing by up to 20% each year. In the 2023–2024 stretch alone, the use of generative AI jumped from 55% to 75%, with companies getting a 3.7x ROI for every buck they invest in GenAI and related technologies.\nThe leading adopters of AI solutions like IBM, Shopify, and Coca‑Cola have moved from using the technology for purely routine tasks to directly boosting employee productivity and speeding up top-line growth. AI-driven productivity tools remain the clearest path to commercial return.\n\nSource: 2024 Business Opportunity of AI\nBusiness Growth Through AI \n\nThe AI adoption curve is still climbing, but how far it goes depends on whom you ask. Goldman Sachs projects a 15% boost to global GDP from AI over the next decade. J.P. Morgan is more restrained, expecting an 8% to 9% increase. Daron Acemoğlu, MIT economics professor, takes a much more cautious view of AI’s global economic impact, projecting only a 1–1.5% boost.\nWhat’s clear is that most value today comes from getting the basics right. You’re more likely to make AI work for your business if you design it with the intent to:\nReduce operational costs\nDrive business growth\nDifferentiate customer experience\nEnsure secure and reliable operations\nAccording to Max Belov, CTO at Coherent Solutions, AI doesn't need to be revolutionary but must first be practical. Too often, companies rush to adopt shiny new tools as part of transformation plans, only to discover they’ve overspent on systems without clear goals or an execution path.\nMax Belov, CTO at Coherent Solutions\nfor TechRadar Pro\nOrganizations need to first sit down, establish realistic goals, and evaluate where AI can support their people and how it can be incorporated into their business objectives.\nYou should clarify who will use AI, at what scale, and how success will be measured to set the stage for real business growth. This will keep projects grounded and make the investment worthwhile.\nCustom AI Models: Accessible and Cost-Effective \n\nThe AI niche used to be very concept-driven back in the day, with investor-seeking designs, Proofs-of-Concept, ICOs, and crowdfunded campaigns reigning supreme.\nWe see real models bringing tangible results and respective profits to their owners and creators. For instance, Accenture reports that AI should bring a 35% productivity boost to the US labor sector by 2035 (as well as to other economies, 36% for Finland, 37% for Sweden, etc.).\nThe boundaries of AI adoption across industries expand even further due to an opportunity to take clean slate AI models and tune them into whatever you need. Customizable AI is readily available today, which means you can save a ton of automation expenses without going far or going broke.\nThis is why a majority of organizations surveyed by Accenture plan to expand beyond pre-built AI solutions to customized or custom-built AI workloads, which brings us to another point.\nThe Current State of AI Adoption \n\nAccording to global AI adoption studies by several sources:\nWithin the top 25% of AI spenders are healthcare, financial agencies and banks, media and telecom, manufacturing, and retail. Following those, energy and materials, consumer goods and ecommerce, hardware engineering, travel, transport, and logistics are all powered by AI to a certain extent. \nAI Adoption Trends Across Key Industries\n\nWe can typically see the highest rates of AI adoption among the operations that must generate or digitize large sets of structured and unstructured data. The greater the data available, the more effectively AI models can be trained, refined, and scaled. So, this data focus works both ways. \nIT and Telecom\nSymbiosis with AI is projected to potentially earn $4.7 trillion in gross value added for IT and telecom by 2035. This is a spacious niche where providers can develop and integrate AI platforms to run a range of internal, technical, and consumer services. \nSource: 2025 Global Telecommunications Outlook\nWe can already witness the pioneers in these niches, like the AI-RAN Alliance, launched back in February 2024. The AI-RAN Alliance gathers the top telecom and tech market leaders to focus efforts on merging AI with cellular technology. The ultimate goal of the alliance is to achieve new advancements in the RAN (radio access network) technology.\nOther use cases for AI adoption in IT and telecom:\nNetwork planning and optimization\nNetwork security\nCX enhancement\nPredictive maintenance\nNetwork slicing\nHealthcare\nNumerous healthcare facilities and brands rely on the custom development of AI solutions. For example, custom AI tools enable safer and hyper-precise drug development and testing, highly detailed medical imaging, and automation of a ton of administrative work.\nSource: AI Adoption in Healthcare Report 2024\nImportantly, the generative AI adoption rate is still only maturing in settings as complex and responsibility-driven as medicine. However, we can already see impressive implementations:\nAt Coherent Solutions, we tapped into the creation of AI for healthcare with the RX transcription tool for an eyewear manufacturer company. This solution helps interpret optical prescriptions and select the right glasses.\nTempus is a precision medicine platform that uses AI to analyze clinical data and personalize cancer care and other treatments.\nPathAI uses deep learning to improve the accuracy of pathology diagnoses for faster, more precise treatments. \nThe NMDP Donor Readiness Score helps predict individual stem cell donor availability.\nOther use cases for AI adoption in healthcare:\nDeveloping drugs \nClinical documentation \nClinical trials\nMedical imaging\nFinance and Banking\nThe productivity of knowledge workers, from accountants and managers to researchers and developers, can be boosted dramatically by automating mundane tasks. Like routine mortgage reviews, market inspection, answering generic customer queries, etc.\nAI tools, like innovative authentication systems, have also been developed to reinforce the security of access and interaction with valuable assets. At Coherent Solutions, we had the pleasure of building a feature-rich identity authentication platform that restricts access based on real-time user behavior monitoring and analysis. \nIn dry figures, the financial sector can get up to $1.2 trillion extra GVA thanks to mass AI adoption in financial services in 2035. But that’s if the market players are not slowed down by the emerging governance of AI adoption in central banks and other associated risks too much.\nUse cases for AI adoption in banking and finance:\nAnomaly detection\nPayments\nRobo-advisors (portfolio management)\nAlgorithmic trading\nManufacturing\nRobotics and IoT help accelerate AI adoption in manufacturing with intelligent systems that connect directly to construction sites and enable remote opportunities. Accenture’s research shows that AI could enrich the manufacturing sector with an extra $3",

              "text": "The Future of Artificial Intelligence\nTuring's predictions about thinking machines in the 1950s laid the philosophical groundwork for later developments in artificial intelligence (AI). Neural network pioneers such as Hinton and LeCun in the 80s and 2000s paved the way for generative models. In turn, the deep learning boom of the 2010s fueled major advances in natural language processing (NLP), image and text generation and medical diagnostics through image segmentation, expanding AI capabilities. These advancements are culminating in multimodal AI, which can seemingly do it all—but just as previous advancements have led to multimodal, what might multimodal AI lead to?\nSince its inception, generative AI (gen AI) has been evolving. Already, we have seen developers such as OpenAI and Meta move away from large models to include smaller and less expensive ones, improving AI models to do the same or more using less. Prompt engineering is changing as models such as ChatGPT get more intelligent and better able to understand the nuances of human language. As LLMs are trained on more specific information, they can provide deep expertise for specialized industries, becoming always-on agents ready to help complete tasks.\nAI is not a flash-in-the-pan technology. It's not a phase. Over 60 countries have developed national AI strategies to harness AI's benefits while mitigating risks. This means substantial investments in research and development, reviewing and adapting relevant policy standards and regulatory frameworks and ensuring the technology doesn’t decimate the fair labor market and international cooperation.\nIt is becoming easier for humans and machines to communicate, enabling AI users to accomplish more with greater proficiency.

Generative AI models such as GPT-4 have shown immense promise in the short time they've been available for public consumption, but their limitations have also become well known. As a result, the future of AI is being defined by a shift toward both open source large-scale models for experimentation and the development of smaller, more efficient models to spur ease of use and facilitate a lower cost.\nInitiatives such as Llama 3.1, an open source AI model with 400 billion parameters and Mistral Large 2, released for research purposes, illustrate the trend of fostering community collaboration in AI projects while maintaining commercial rights. The growing interest in smaller models has led to the creation of models such as the 11 billion parameter mini GPT 4o-mini, which is fast and cost-effective. It won't be long before there's a model suitable for embedding in devices such as smartphones, especially as the cost continues to decrease.\nThis movement reflects a transition from exclusively large, closed models to more accessible and versatile AI solutions. While smaller models offer affordability and efficiency, there remains a public demand for more powerful AI systems, indicating there will likely be a balanced approach in AI development to attempt to prioritize both scalability and accessibility. These new models deliver greater precision with fewer resources, making them ideal for enterprises needing bespoke content creation or complex problem-solving capabilities.\nAI has influenced the development of several core technologies. AI plays a pivotal role in advancing computer vision by enabling more accurate image and video analysis, which is essential for technologies such as autonomous vehicles and medical diagnostics. In natural language processing (NLP), AI enhances the ability of machines to comprehend and generate human language, improving communication interfaces and enabling more sophisticated translation and sentiment analysis tools.\nAI supercharges predictive and big data analytics by processing and interpreting vast amounts of data to forecast trends and inform decisions. In robotics, the development of more autonomous and adaptable machines simplifies tasks such as assembly, exploration and service delivery. Also, AI-driven innovations on the Internet of Things (IoT) enhance the connectivity and intelligence of devices, leading to smarter homes, cities and industrial systems.\nAI in 2034\nHere are some of the advancements in AI that we should see in ten years:\nMultimodal status quo\nThe fledgling field of multimodal AI will be thoroughly tested and refined by 2034. Unimodal AI focuses on a single data type, such as NLP or computer vision. In contrast, multimodal AI more closely resembles how humans communicate by understanding data across visuals, voice, facial expressions and vocal inflections. This technology will integrate text, voice, images, videos and other data to create more intuitive interactions between humans and computer systems. It has the potential to power advanced virtual assistants and chatbots that understand complex queries and can provide bespoke text, visual aids or video tutorials in response.\nDemocratization of AI and easier model creation\nAI will become even more integrated into personal and professional spheres, driven by user-friendly platforms that allow nonexperts to use AI for business, individual tasks, research and creative projects. These platforms, similar to today's website builders, will enable entrepreneurs, educators and small businesses to develop custom AI solutions without requiring deep technical expertise.\nAPI-driven AI and microservices will allow businesses to integrate advanced AI functions into their existing systems in a modular fashion. This approach will speed up the development of custom applications without requiring extensive AI expertise.\nFor enterprises, easier model creation means faster innovation cycles, with custom AI tools for every business function. No-code and low-code platforms will allow non-technical users to create AI models by using drag-and-drop components, plug-and-play modules or guided workflows. As many of these platforms will be LLM-based, users can also query up an AI model using prompts.\nAuto-ML platforms are rapidly improving, automating tasks such as data preprocessing, feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. Over the next decade, Auto-ML will become even more user-friendly and accessible, allowing people to create high-performing AI models quickly without specialized expertise. Cloud-based AI services will also provide businesses with prebuilt AI models that can be customized, integrated and scaled as needed.\nFor hobbyists, accessible AI tools will foster a new wave of individual innovation, allowing them to develop AI applications for personal projects or side businesses.\nOpen-source development can foster transparency, while careful governance and ethical guidelines might help maintain high-security standards and build trust in AI-driven processes. The culmination of this ease of access might be a fully voice-controlled multimodal virtual assistant capable of creating visual, text, audio or visual assets on demand.\nThough very speculative, if an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system emerges by 2034, we might see the dawn of AI systems that can autonomously generate, curate and refine their own training datasets, enabling self-improvement and adaptation without human intervention.\nHallucination insurance\nAs generative AI becomes more centralized within organizations, companies might start to offer \"AI hallucination insurance.\" Despite extensive training, AI models can deliver incorrect or misleading results.

              "text": "Trends You Don't Want to Miss\nAnticipating the continuous growth of the AI market, companies and entrepreneurs rush to implement “the latest tech” and “advanced AI models” without too much prior strategizing. To ride the profitable and beneficial wave of AI adoption, however, having a roadmap is paramount.\nThis article goes into detailed AI adoption statistics and real-world use cases by industry and task. It provides insights into how exactly you can use available AI opportunities and maximize the efficiency of your decision.\nContents \n\nGlobal AI Market Overview\nBusiness Growth Through AI\nCustom AI Models: Accessible and Cost-Effective \nThe Current State of AI Adoption\nAI Adoption Trends Across Key Industries\nPhases And Milestones In The AI Adoption Roadmap\nAI Energy Dilemma\nAnalyzing Job Exposure and Disruption Risks\nAgentic AI\nHow AI Drives Business Transformation\nMain AI Adoption Challenges\nEnter the AI Future with Confidence\nGlobal AI Market Overview\n\nAnalysts project sustained global AI market growth, which is set to surpass $240 billion in total value. AI adoption by the industry is growing by up to 20% each year. In the 2023–2024 stretch alone, the use of generative AI jumped from 55% to 75%, with companies getting a 3.7x ROI for every buck they invest in GenAI and related technologies.\nThe leading adopters of AI solutions like IBM, Shopify, and Coca‑Cola have moved from using the technology for purely routine tasks to directly boosting employee productivity and speeding up top-line growth. AI-driven productivity tools remain the clearest path to commercial return.\n\nSource: 2024 Business Opportunity of AI\nBusiness Growth Through AI \n\nThe AI adoption curve is still climbing, but how far it goes depends on whom you ask. Goldman Sachs projects a 15% boost to global GDP from AI over the next decade. J.P. Morgan is more restrained, expecting an 8% to 9% increase. Daron Acemoğlu, MIT economics professor, takes a much more cautious view of AI’s global economic impact, projecting only a 1–1.5% boost.\nWhat’s clear is that most value today comes from getting the basics right. You’re more likely to make AI work for your business if you design it with the intent to:\nReduce operational costs\nDrive business growth\nDifferentiate customer experience\nEnsure secure and reliable operations\nAccording to Max Belov, CTO at Coherent Solutions, AI doesn't need to be revolutionary but must first be practical. Too often, companies rush to adopt shiny new tools as part of transformation plans, only to discover they’ve overspent on systems without clear goals or an execution path.\nMax Belov, CTO at Coherent Solutions\nfor TechRadar Pro\nOrganizations need to first sit down, establish realistic goals, and evaluate where AI can support their people and how it can be incorporated into their business objectives.\nYou should clarify who will use AI, at what scale, and how success will be measured to set the stage for real business growth. This will keep projects grounded and make the investment worthwhile.\nCustom AI Models: Accessible and Cost-Effective \n\nThe AI niche used to be very concept-driven back in the day, with investor-seeking designs, Proofs-of-Concept, ICOs, and crowdfunded campaigns reigning supreme.\nWe see real models bringing tangible results and respective profits to their owners and creators. For instance, Accenture reports that AI should bring a 35% productivity boost to the US labor sector by 2035 (as well as to other economies, 36% for Finland, 37% for Sweden, etc.).\nThe boundaries of AI adoption across industries expand even further due to an opportunity to take clean slate AI models and tune them into whatever you need. Customizable AI is readily available today, which means you can save a ton of automation expenses without going far or going broke.\nThis is why a majority of organizations surveyed by Accenture plan to expand beyond pre-built AI solutions to customized or custom-built AI workloads, which brings us to another point.\nThe Current State of AI Adoption \n\nAccording to global AI adoption studies by several sources:\nWithin the top 25% of AI spenders are healthcare, financial agencies and banks, media and telecom, manufacturing, and retail. Following those, energy and materials, consumer goods and ecommerce, hardware engineering, travel, transport, and logistics are all powered by AI to a certain extent. \nAI Adoption Trends Across Key Industries\n\nWe can typically see the highest rates of AI adoption among the operations that must generate or digitize large sets of structured and unstructured data. The greater the data available, the more effectively AI models can be trained, refined, and scaled. So, this data focus works both ways. \nIT and Telecom\nSymbiosis with AI is projected to potentially earn $4.7 trillion in gross value added for IT and telecom by 2035. This is a spacious niche where providers can develop and integrate AI platforms to run a range of internal, technical, and consumer services. \nSource: 2025 Global Telecommunications Outlook\nWe can already witness the pioneers in these niches, like the AI-RAN Alliance, launched back in February 2024. The AI-RAN Alliance gathers the top telecom and tech market leaders to focus efforts on merging AI with cellular technology. The ultimate goal of the alliance is to achieve new advancements in the RAN (radio access network) technology.\nOther use cases for AI adoption in IT and telecom:\nNetwork planning and optimization\nNetwork security\nCX enhancement\nPredictive maintenance\nNetwork slicing\nHealthcare\nNumerous healthcare facilities and brands rely on the custom development of AI solutions. For example, custom AI tools enable safer and hyper-precise drug development and testing, highly detailed medical imaging, and automation of a ton of administrative work.\nSource: AI Adoption in Healthcare Report 2024\nImportantly, the generative AI adoption rate is still only maturing in settings as complex and responsibility-driven as medicine. However, we can already see impressive implementations:\nAt Coherent Solutions, we tapped into the creation of AI for healthcare with the RX transcription tool for an eyewear manufacturer company. This solution helps interpret optical prescriptions and select the right glasses.\nTempus is a precision medicine platform that uses AI to analyze clinical data and personalize cancer care and other treatments.\nPathAI uses deep learning to improve the accuracy of pathology diagnoses for faster, more precise treatments. \nThe NMDP Donor Readiness Score helps predict individual stem cell donor availability.\nOther use cases for AI adoption in healthcare:\nDeveloping drugs \nClinical documentation \nClinical trials\nMedical imaging\nFinance and Banking\nThe productivity of knowledge workers, from accountants and managers to researchers and developers, can be boosted dramatically by automating mundane tasks. Like routine mortgage reviews, market inspection, answering generic customer queries, etc.\nAI tools, like innovative authentication systems, have also been developed to reinforce the security of access and interaction with valuable assets. At Coherent Solutions, we had the pleasure of building a feature-rich identity authentication platform that restricts access based on real-time user behavior monitoring and analysis. \nIn dry figures, the financial sector can get up to $1.2 trillion extra GVA thanks to mass AI adoption in financial services in 2035. But that’s if the market players are not slowed down by the emerging governance of AI adoption in central banks and other associated risks too much.\nUse cases for AI adoption in banking and finance:\nAnomaly detection\nPayments\nRobo-advisors (portfolio management)\nAlgorithmic trading\nManufacturing\nRobotics and IoT help accelerate AI adoption in manufacturing with intelligent systems that connect directly to construction sites and enable remote opportunities. Accenture’s research shows that AI could enrich the manufacturing sector with an extra $3",

              "text": "What’s next for AI in 2024\nMIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of our series here.\nThis time last year we did something reckless. In an industry where nothing stands still, we had a go at predicting the future. \nHow did we do? Our four big bets for 2023 were that the next big thing in chatbots would be multimodal (check: the most powerful large language models out there, OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini, work with text, images and audio); that policymakers would draw up tough new regulations (check: Biden’s executive order came out in October and the European Union’s AI Act was finally agreed in December); Big Tech would feel pressure from open-source startups (half right: the open-source boom continues, but AI companies like OpenAI and Google DeepMind still stole the limelight); and that AI would change big pharma for good (too soon to tell: the AI revolution in drug discovery is in full swing, but the first drugs developed using AI are still some years from market).\nNow we’re doing it again.\nWe decided to ignore the obvious. We know that large language models will continue to dominate. Regulators will grow bolder. AI’s problems—from bias to copyright to doomerism—will shape the agenda for researchers, regulators, and the public, not just in 2024 but for years to come. (Read more about our six big questions for generative AI here.)\nInstead, we’ve picked a few more specific trends. Here’s what to watch out for in 2024. (Come back next year and check how we did.)\n1\nCustomized chatbots\nYou get a chatbot! And you get a chatbot! In 2024, tech companies that invested heavily in generative AI will be under pressure to prove that they can make money off their products. To do this, AI giants Google and OpenAI are betting big on going small: both are developing user-friendly platforms that allow people to customize powerful language models and make their own mini chatbots that cater to their specific needs—no coding skills required. Both have launched web-based tools that allow anyone to become a generative-AI app developer. \nIn 2024, generative AI might actually become useful for the regular, non-tech person, and we are going to see more people tinkering with a million little AI models. State-of-the-art AI models, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, are multimodal, meaning they can process not only text but images and even videos. This new capability could unlock a whole bunch of new apps. For example, a real estate agent can upload text from previous listings, fine-tune a powerful model to generate similar text with just a click of a button, upload videos and photos of new listings, and simply ask the customized AI to generate a description of the property. \nBut of course, the success of this plan hinges on whether these models work reliably. Language models often make stuff up, and generative models are riddled with biases. They are also easy to hack, especially if they are allowed to browse the web. Tech companies have not solved any of these problems. When the novelty wears off, they’ll have to offer their customers ways to deal with these problems. \n—Melissa Heikkilä\nSTEPHANIE ARNETT/MITTR | ENVATO\n2\nGenerative AI’s second wave will be video\nIt’s amazing how fast the fantastic becomes familiar. The first generative models to produce photorealistic images exploded into the mainstream in 2022—and soon became commonplace. Tools like OpenAI’s DALL-E, Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion, and Adobe’s Firefly flooded the internet with jaw-dropping images of everything from the pope in Balenciaga to prize-winning art. But it’s not all good fun: for every pug waving pompoms, there’s another piece of knock-off fantasy art or sexist sexual stereotyping.\nThe new frontier is text-to-video. Expect it to take everything that was good, bad, or ugly about text-to-image and supersize it.\nA year ago we got the first glimpse of what generative models could do when they were trained to stitch together multiple still images into clips a few seconds long. The results were distorted and jerky. But the tech has rapidly improved.\nRunway, a startup that makes generative video models (and the company that co-created Stable Diffusion), is dropping new versions of its tools every few months. Its latest model, called Gen-2, still generates video just a few seconds long, but the quality is striking. The best clips aren’t far off what Pixar might put out.\nRunway has set up an annual AI film festival that showcases experimental movies made with a range of AI tools. This year’s festival has a $60,000 prize pot, and the 10 best films will be screened in New York and Los Angeles.\nIt’s no surprise that top studios are taking notice. Movie giants, including Paramount and Disney, are now exploring the use of generative AI throughout their production pipeline. The tech is being used to lip-sync actors’ performances to multiple foreign-language overdubs. And it is reinventing what’s possible with special effects. In 2023, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny starred a de-aged deepfake Harrison Ford. This is just the start. \nAway from the big screen, deepfake tech for marketing or training purposes is taking off too. For example, UK-based Synthesia makes tools that can turn a one-off performance by an actor into an endless stream of deepfake avatars, reciting whatever script you give them at the push of a button. According to the company, its tech is now used by 44% of Fortune 100 companies. \nThe ability to do so much with so little raises serious questions for actors. Concerns about studios’ use and misuse of AI were at the heart of the SAG-AFTRA strikes last year. But the true impact of the tech is only just becoming apparent. “The craft of filmmaking is fundamentally changing,” says Souki Mehdaoui, an independent filmmaker and cofounder of Bell & Whistle, a consultancy specializing in creative technologies.\n—Will Douglas Heaven\n3\nAI-generated election disinformation will be everywhere \nIf recent elections are anything to go by, AI-generated election disinformation and deepfakes are going to be a huge problem as a record number of people march to the polls in 2024. We’re already seeing politicians weaponizing these tools. In Argentina, two presidential candidates created AI-generated images and videos of their opponents to attack them. In Slovakia, deepfakes of a liberal pro-European party leader threatening to raise the price of beer and making jokes about child pornography spread like wildfire during the country’s elections. And in the US, Donald Trump has cheered on a group that uses AI to generate memes with racist and sexist tropes. \nWhile it’s hard to say how much these examples have influenced the outcomes of elections, their proliferation is a worrying trend. It will become harder than ever to recognize what is real online. In an already inflamed and polarized political climate, this could have severe consequences.\nJust a few years ago creating a deepfake would have required advanced technical skills, but generative AI has made it stupidly easy and accessible, and the outputs are looking increasingly realistic. Even reputable sources might be fooled by AI-generated content. For example, users-submitted AI-generated images purporting to depict the Israel-Gaza crisis have flooded stock image marketplaces like Adobe’s. \nThe coming year will be pivotal for those fighting against the proliferation of such content. Techniques to track and mitigate it content are still in early days of development. Watermarks, such as Google DeepMind’s SynthID, are still mostly voluntary and not completely foolproof. And social media platforms are notoriously slow in taking down misinformation. Get ready for a massive real-time experiment in busting AI-generated fake news. \n—Melissa Heikkilä\nSTEPHANIE ARNETT/MITTR | ISTOCK, ENVATO\n4\nRobots that multitask\nInspired by some of the core technique",

Understand Your “Why”\n\nBefore embarking on your weight loss journey, it's crucial to identify your motivations. Whether it's to reduce the risk of chronic diseases or to enhance your physical well-being, write down these reasons for easy reference. Studies show that even modest weight loss (5-10% of total body weight) can improve health markers such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels (CDC, 2025).\n\n**Resources:**\n- [CDC: Steps for Losing Weight](https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-weight-growth/losing-weight/index.html)\n\n#### 2. Set Specific, Realistic Goals\n\nSet achievable short-term goals, such as consuming more fruits and vegetables or committing to a daily walk. Break larger goals into manageable steps. For example, instead of saying, \"I want to lose 20 pounds,\" consider \"I will walk for 15 minutes a day for one week.\" Regularly reassess your goals and make adjustments as needed to stay motivated and avoid frustration (Mayo Clinic, 2025).\n\n**Resources:**\n- [Mayo Clinic: 6 Strategies for Success](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/weight-loss/art-20047752)\n\n#### 3. Keep a Food Diary\n\nTracking your food intake can significantly enhance your success. Keeping a detailed food diary helps identify eating patterns, allowing for informed decisions about what and how much you eat. Use apps or traditional diaries to track meals and even emotional state while eating (Medical News Today, 2025).\n\n**Resources:**\n- [Medical News Today: 10 Tips to Lose Weight](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/303409)\n\n#### 4. Get Active, Stay Active\n\nRegular exercise complements your diet and supports weight loss. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity weekly. Strength training should also be included at least twice a week. Even small changes, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator or participating in physical activities you enjoy, can contribute to your fitness goals (Everyday Health, 2025).\n\n**Resources:**\n- [Everyday Health: 24 Tips for Weight Loss](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-and-nutrition/diet/tips-weight-loss-actually-work/)\n\n#### 5. Meal Planning\n\nPlanning your meals ahead can help maintain a balanced diet and control portion sizes. When meals are prepared in advance, it simplifies grocery shopping and minimizes the risk of opting for unhealthy convenience foods. A recent study highlighted that meal planning is more frequently used by successful weight-loss maintainers (PMC, 2025).\n\n**Resources:**\n- [PMC: Meal Planning and Weight Loss](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5288891/)\n\n---\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nWeight loss is a journey that requires commitment, patience, and a multifaceted approach. By understanding your motivation, setting realistic goals, keeping a food diary, incorporating regular physical activity, and planning your meals, you can pave the way to a healthier you. Remember, every small step counts in reaching your weight loss goals!\n\n---\n\n### AI-Generated Image of Healthy Meals\n\n![Healthy Meals](https://www.recraft.ai/generate/food)  \n\n#### PDF Download\n\nThe complete article has been prepared and saved into a PDF.

              "text": "Steps for Losing Weight | Healthy Weight and Growth\nIf you want to lose weight, making a specific plan can help.\nHealthy weight loss includes a lifestyle with healthy eating patterns, regular physical activity, enough sleep, and stress management.\nThe five steps on this page can help you get started.\nOverview\nA lifestyle with good nutrition, regular physical activity, stress management, and enough sleep supports a healthy weight. People who lose weight at a gradual, steady pace—about 1 to 2 pounds a week—are more likely to keep the weight off than people who lose weight quicker.\nFactors, such as medicines, medical conditions, stress, genes, hormones, environment, and age can also affect weight management. \nIf you're concerned about your weight or have questions about your medications, talk with your health care provider. When you are ready to get started, explore these five steps to guide you to a healthier weight.\nStep 1: Understand your \"why\"\nConsider why you want to lose weight, whether it's because heart disease runs in your family or you want to be more physically active. Writing down your reasons will help you stay focused on your goal. Place your reasons where you can see them daily to remind yourself why you want to make this change.\nEven modest weight loss helps\nIf you are not at a healthy weight, even modest weight loss can help improve your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. For example, a 5% weight reduction for a person who weighs 200 pounds is 10 pounds. This change could lower the risk for some chronic diseases such as heart disease, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes.\nStep 2: Track where you are\nTracking where you are now helps to identify how you want to improve your health. You can start by tracking your nutrition, physical activity, and sleep. Write down or use an app to track:\nNutrition: Include everything you consume for a few days in a food and beverage diary. This will help you see what you eat and drink and consider how to make small changes.\nPhysical activity: Include time of day, what activity you did, and duration in a physical activity diary.\nSleep: Include the hours of sleep you get. The amount you need changes as you age.\nStress: Include healthy ways you are reducing your stress.\nOther wellness factors you can track include how you are feeling when you eat and drink and are active, and lifestyle challenges. To track lifestyle challenges, you can ask yourself questions like the ones included in the table below. If you answer yes, consider ways to overcome those challenges.\nStep 3: Set specific goals you can reach in a realistic time\nSet short-term goals and reward your efforts along the way. Short-term goals might include drinking water instead of sugary beverages, taking a 15-minute evening walk, or having a vegetable with supper.\nFocus on two or three goals at a time. Effective goals are specific and realistic. For example, \"exercise more\" is not specific. But \"I will walk 15 minutes, 3 days a week for the first week,\" is specific and potentially more realistic.\nSetting unrealistic goals, such as losing 20 pounds in 2 weeks, can leave you feeling defeated and frustrated.\nRemember, occasional setbacks happen. This is expected. When they happen, get back on track as quickly as possible. Then, think about how to prevent setbacks in similar future situations.\nEveryone is different. What works for someone else might not be right for you. For example, to help you be more active, try a variety of physical activities, such as walking, swimming, tennis, or group exercise classes. See what you enjoy most and can fit into your life. These activities will be easier to stick with over the long term.\nStep 4: Find support\nIdentify family members or friends who will support your weight loss efforts. Coworkers or neighbors with similar goals might share healthy recipes and plan group physical activities. \nIt may help to join a weight-loss program or visit a health care professional, such as a nutrition or weight-loss specialist. Ask for a follow-up appointment to monitor changes in your weight and any related health conditions.\nYou can also ask your health care provider for resources to support a healthy weight. This may include referral to a registered dietitian, clinical or community programs, federally approved medications or devices, or weight-loss (bariatric) surgery.\nEstablishing healthy habits are very difficult when healthy choices are limited. Consider looking up your local community resources, such as food pantries, farmers markets, parks and recreation, and trails. \nFood assistance and food systems resources\nResources for food assistance in everyday situations, as well as before, during, and after emergencies and disasters. These resources are for individuals and organizations.\nStep 5: Monitor your progress\nEvaluate your progress regularly by revisiting your goals. Decide which parts of your plan are working well and which parts need to be changed. Use this information to revise your goals and plan.\nIf you consistently meet a particular goal, add a new goal to help continue your pathway to success.\nReward yourself for your achievements! Recognize when you're meeting your goals and be proud of your progress. Use non-food rewards, such as a bouquet of fresh flowers, a sports outing with friends, or a relaxing bath. Rewards help keep you motivated on the path to better health.\nJanuary 17, 2025",

Regular physical activity helps burn off extra calories.\nExercise has many other benefits. It can lift your mood, lower blood pressure and help you sleep better. Exercise helps you keep off the weight that you lose too. Studies show that people who maintain their weight loss over the long term get regular physical activity.\nHow many calories you burn depends on how often, how long and how hard you exercise. One of the best ways to lose body fat is through steady aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking. Work up to at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise most days of the week. Some people may need more exercise than this to lose weight and keep it off.\nAlso aim to do strength training exercises at least twice a week. You could lift weights, use exercise bands or do pushups.\nAny extra movement helps you burn calories. So think about ways to move more during the day. You could:\nUse the stairs instead of an elevator.\nPark at the far end of the lot when you shop.\nStand instead of sit while you talk on the phone or check email.\nWalk laps around the room or march in place while you watch TV.",

              "text": "10 tips to lose weight\nShare on PinterestDesign by MNT; Photography by Kseniya Ovchinnikova/Getty Images & Westend61/Getty Images\nPeople can lose weight and help maintain this loss by taking several achievable steps. These include:\n1. Eat varied, colorful, nutritionally dense foods\nHealthful meals and snacks should form the foundation of the human diet. A simple way to create a meal plan is to ensure that each meal consists of fruit and vegetables, whole grains, and protein. Total fiber intake should be 25 to 30 grams (g) daily.\nA person should also aim to eliminate trans fats from the diet and minimize the intake of saturated fats, which has a strong link to the incidence of coronary heart disease.\nThe following foods are healthful and rich in nutrients:\nfresh fruits and vegetables\nfish\nlegumes\nnuts\nseeds\nwhole grains, such as brown rice and oatmeal\nFoods to limit eating include:\nfoods with added oils, butter, and sugar\nfatty red or processed meats\nbaked goods\nnutrient-poor processed foods such as chips or cookies\nIn some cases, removing certain foods from the diet might cause a person to become deficient in necessary vitamins and minerals. A registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) can advise a person on how to get enough nutrients while following a weight loss program.\n2. Keep a food and weight diary\nSelf-monitoring is a helpful tool in successfully losing weight. People can use a paper diary, mobile app, or dedicated website to record every food they consume daily. They can also measure their progress by recording their weight every week.\nThose who can track their success in small increments and identify physical changes are likelier to stick to a weight loss regimen. However, it is important to pay attention to whether it starts to feel obsessive or damaging to mental health. \n3. Engage in regular physical activity and exercise\nRegular exercise is vital for both physical and mental health. Increasing the frequency of physical activity in a disciplined and purposeful way is often crucial for successful weight loss.\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) recommends 150 minutes weekly of moderate-intensity daily activity, such as brisk walking.\nPeople who are not usually physically active can gradually increase the amount of exercise they do and its intensity. This approach is the most sustainable way to ensure that regular exercise becomes a part of their lifestyle.\nIn the same way that recording meals can psychologically help with weight loss, people may also benefit from tracking their physical activity. Many free mobile apps can help people stay motivated, accountable, and confident as their fitness improves. \nIf the thought of a full workout seems intimidating to someone new to exercise, they can begin by doing the following activities to help increase their exercise levels:\ntaking the stairs\nraking leaves\nwalking a dog\ngardening\ndancing\nplaying outdoor games\nparking farther away from a building entrance\nIndividuals who have a low risk of coronary heart disease are unlikely to require medical assessment ahead of starting an exercise regimen.\nHowever, prior medical evaluation may be advisable for some people, including those with diabetes. Anyone unsure about safe levels of exercise can speak with a healthcare professional.\n4. Eliminate liquid calories\nIt is possible to consume hundreds of calories daily by drinking sugar-sweetened soda, tea, juice, or alcohol. These are known as “empty calories” because they provide extra energy content without offering any nutritional benefits. \nUnless a person consumes a smoothie to replace a meal, they can stick to water or unsweetened tea and coffee. Adding a fresh lemon or orange to the water can provide flavor.\nAvoid mistaking dehydration for hunger. An individual can often satisfy feelings of hunger between scheduled meal times with a drink of water.\n5. Measure servings and control portions\nToo much of any food, especially those that are calorie-dense, can result in weight gain.\nEstimating portions is a realistic and helpful tool for many people who do not have access to measuring tools or do not want to use them.\nThe following size comparisons can be useful for monitoring food intake when dining out:\na fist is equivalent to about 1 cup, measuring portions of vegetables and fruits \na tennis ball is equivalent to about ½ cup, measuring portions of grains such as rice or pasta \na deck of cards is equivalent to about 3 ounces, measuring a portion of fish, chicken, or other meats and meat substitutes \na thumb is equivalent to about 1 tablespoon, measuring a portion of any nut butter, olive oil, or salad dressing \nThese sizes are not exact, but they can help people moderate their food intake when the correct tools are unavailable.\n6. Eat mindfully\nMany people may benefit from mindful eating, which involves being fully aware of why, how, when, where, and what they eat.\nPeople becoming more in tune with their bodies may lead to making healthier food choices. \nPeople who practice mindful eating also try to eat more slowly and savor their food, concentrating on the taste. Making a meal last for 20 minutes allows the body to register all of the signals for satiety.\nIt is important to focus on being satisfied after a meal rather than full and to remember that many “all-natural” or low fat foods are not necessarily healthy choices.\n7. Stimulus and cue control\nMany social and environmental cues might encourage unnecessary eating. For example, some people are more likely to overeat while watching television, and others have difficulty passing a candy bowl to someone else without taking a piece.\nBy being aware of what may trigger the desire to snack on empty calories, people can think of ways to adjust their routine to limit these triggers.\n8. Plan ahead\nStocking up with nutritious food for structured meal plans will result in more significant weight loss. Prepping ahead, such as washing and peeling fruits and veggies, can also help make healthier food choices.\nLimit the amount of highly processed snack foods and desserts in the home, and make sure to keep ingredients on hand to make quick, nutritious meals. This can help minimize mindless eating and make it easier to make healthier food choices. \nPlanning food choices before social events or restaurants might also make the process easier.\n9. Seek social support\nEmbracing the support of loved ones is an integral part of a successful weight loss journey.\nSome people may wish to invite friends or family members to join them, while others might prefer to use social media to share their progress.\nOther avenues of support may include:\na positive social network\ngroup or individual counseling\nexercise clubs or partners\nemployee-assistance programs at work\n10. Stay positive\nWeight loss is a gradual process, and people may feel discouraged if their weight does not reduce at the rate they had anticipated.\nSticking to a weight loss or maintenance program will be more challenging on some days than others. A successful weight-loss program requires perseverance and not giving up when self-change seems too difficult.\nSome people might need to reset their goals by adjusting the total number of calories they aim to eat or changing their exercise patterns.\nThe important thing is to keep a positive outlook and be persistent in working toward overcoming the barriers to successful weight loss.\nSuccessful weight loss does not require following a specific diet plan. Instead, people can focus on eating nutrient-rich foods and moving more to achieve a negative energy balance.\nWeight loss primarily depends on reducing the total intake of calories, not adjusting the proportions of carbohydrates, fat, and protein in the diet.\nThe best way to avoid regaining lost weight is to follow a weight maintenance program that includes healthy eating habits and regular physical activity.\nPrescription weight-loss medications may benefit people with a body mass index (BMI) equal to or higher than 30 and no obe",

              "text": "24 Weight Loss Tips to Lose Weight the Healthy Way\n12. Think Big — Not Small\n“Focus on the weight loss ‘big rocks’ — there are a few areas that will give you the most bang for your buck when you’re trying to lose weight. Prioritizing those and letting go of all the minutiae that contribute to overwhelm will make reaching your goals feel easier and more sustainable. On the nutrition front, pay attention to calories, protein, and fiber. For exercise, prioritize strength training, daily steps, and recovery.”\n— Avant\n13. Look Beyond the Scale\n“While the scale isn’t useless, it also isn’t the only thing that matters. To help you gauge progress that might not be reflected on the scale, take regular photos and measurements, in addition to keeping a running list of non-scale victories. This will help keep the scale in perspective and show you all the positive changes you’re making to your health and overall lifestyle.”\n— Avant\n14. Give Your Breakfast a Protein Boost\n“Aim for 15 to 25 grams of protein at breakfast. Protein is digested slowly and suppresses hunger hormones, helping keep you full. Additionally, a high-protein breakfast helps curb cravings later in the day. Pair protein-rich foods with fiber and healthy fats, like two eggs with whole-wheat toast and avocado or high-protein frozen waffles with nuts, berries, and a little maple syrup.”\n— Younkin\n15. Incorporate Protein Into Every Meal\n“Eating protein-rich foods at every meal, especially breakfast, can help shave extra pounds. Protein slows down the digestive process and positively impacts your hunger hormones. Protein can also do better at staving off hunger than carbohydrates. Protein-rich foods include quinoa, edamame, beans, seeds, nuts, eggs, yogurt, cheese, tofu, lentil pasta, poultry, fish, and meat.”\n— Christine M. Palumbo, RDN, a nutrition consultant from Naperville, Illinois\n16. Try to Eat Mainly Whole, Minimally Processed Foods\n“The multiple processing steps and added ingredients are the reason processed foods taste so good and we keep wanting more. They tend to contain large amounts of added sugars, fats, and salt. Research suggests that people can take in up to 500 more calories a day when they’re offered unlimited amounts of ultra-processed foods compared to unprocessed foods.”\n— Palumbo\n17. Experiment With Fruits at Dessert Time\n“Fruits are low in calories and carry tons of nutrients like antioxidants and fiber. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only about 12 percent of the U.S. population is meeting their fruit intake and only 10 percent is meeting their vegetable intake. Using fruits for dessert will help you meet your daily requirements but also add flavor to your day. Many fruits can be sautéed, grilled, or baked. For example, a grilled peach topped with vanilla yogurt and shaved almonds is amazing!”\n— Sue-Ellen Anderson Haynes, RDN, CDCES, a certified personal trainer and national media spokesperson of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics who is based in Boston\n18. Eat a Large Breakfast and a Small Dinner\n“You’ll want to take in more of your calories earlier in the day. A study published in 2019 found that subjects who were given small breakfasts and large dinners lost significantly less weight than those assigned to a large breakfast and a smaller dinner. So smaller meals in the latter part of the day may be an advantage to those who want to lose weight and improve overall health. However, each person has individual needs, which may require additional snacks and food, such as those who are pregnant, are breastfeeding, have diabetes, or take medication that require certain foods. This is why it is so important that you seek a consultation with a registered dietitian-nutritionist.”\n— Anderson Haynes\n19. Get Into Meal Planning\n“Meal planning is one of my top tips for staying healthy and eating well. I’m such a fan of the concept that I wrote a book about it! Taking 5 to 10 minutes over the weekend to write out a menu for the week ahead will save you time, money, and unwanted calories down the road. Not sure what to make for dinner tonight? No worries, it’s already on your menu plan. Menu planning is a great way to stay organized, and know what groceries you need to buy and what you already have on hand, and it will help ensure a balanced plate. Keep in mind, a night off from cooking and ordering takeout or making a frozen meal is a totally acceptable part of the menu plan. And be sure to write down the plan — you’re more likely to stick to it if it’s in front of you as a reminder.”\n— Jessica Levinson, RDN, author of 52-Week Meal Planner: The Complete Guide to Planning Menus, Groceries, Recipes, and More\n20. Make a Grocery List and Stick to It\n“Once you have your menu planned for the week, make a shopping list either on paper or on your phone — I use Notes, but there are apps for this too. Knowing in advance what you need to purchase at the supermarket will save you time, reduce food waste, and prevent you from purchasing items that look appealing but you don’t actually need. To stick with your list, avoid shopping when hungry. Research shows an increase in impulsive behavior at that time.”\n— Levinson\n21. Take Stock of What’s in Your Kitchen\n“To cook healthy meals, you need the right ingredients and kitchen tools on hand. Some staple ingredients I recommend having in your pantry, fridge, and freezer are low-sodium canned beans, canned fish, tomato sauce, whole-grain pasta, quinoa, brown rice, low-sodium stock, low-fat plain yogurt, a variety of fresh and frozen fruit and vegetables, olive oil, and dried herbs and spices. These are just some of the ingredients that can form the base of a healthy and delicious meal.”\n— Levinson\n22. Have the Right Tools on Hand\n“Similarly, having a good mix of kitchen tools can help ensure easy, efficient, and healthy cooking. For example, a seasoned cast-iron skillet is one of my favorite pans to cook eggs, sauté vegetables, and make pancakes, since I don’t have to use as much oil or butter to keep food from sticking. Some of my other favorite kitchen tools are an immersion blender, Instant Pot, baking sheets, measuring cups and spoons, and a hand juicer. And of course anyone working in the kitchen should have a quality set of knives.”\n— Levinson\n23. Read Food Labels\n“Getting into the habit of flipping your packages over can save you time, money, and even calories. Food labels give you a clear picture of what you’re really getting, and if you want to lose weight healthfully, it’s not just about how many calories you’re getting — it’s also about what kind of calories you’re getting. To make sure that your meals are valuable, be sure that you’re getting a balance of nutrients without overdoing sodium, sugar, and saturated fat.”\n— Bonnie Taub-Dix, RDN, CND, author of Read It Before You Eat It — Taking You From Label to Table\n24. Choose Super Snacks\n“It’s best to look at your snacks as mini meals. We are snacking more than ever, so it’s best to choose snacks with benefits, like almond butter and a sliced apple or Greek yogurt topped with fruit and a high fiber cereal. It’s not easy to get everything you need in a day, so nutritionally rich snacks can help fill that gap while also making you feel more full and satisfied.”\n— Taub-Dix",

            "content": "### Article: Effective Strategies for Weight Loss\n\nLosing weight effectively is not just about looking good; it’s about improving your overall health and well-being. As many people struggle with weight management, employing a holistic approach that combines various strategies is essential for lasting success. Below are scientifically backed methods that can help you shed pounds and maintain a healthy lifestyle.\n\n#### 1. Understand Your “Why”  \nBefore embarking on your weight loss journey, it's crucial to identify your motivations. Whether it's to reduce the risk of chronic diseases or to enhance your physical well-being, write down these reasons for easy reference. Studies show that even modest weight loss (5-10% of total body weight) can improve health markers such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels (CDC, 2025).\n\n**Resources:**  \n- [CDC: Steps for Losing Weight](https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-weight-growth/losing-weight/index.html)\n\n#### 2. Set Specific, Realistic Goals  \nSet achievable short-term goals, such as consuming more fruits and vegetables or committing to a daily walk. Break larger goals into manageable steps. For example, instead of saying, \"I want to lose 20 pounds,\" consider \"I will walk for 15 minutes a day for one week.\" Regularly reassess your goals and make adjustments as needed to stay motivated and avoid frustration (Mayo Clinic, 2025).\n\n**Resources:**  \n- [Mayo Clinic: 6 Strategies for Success](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/weight-loss/art-20047752)\n\n#### 3. Keep a Food Diary  \nTracking your food intake can significantly enhance your success. Keeping a detailed food diary helps identify eating patterns, allowing for informed decisions about what and how much you eat. Use apps or traditional diaries to track meals and even emotional state while eating (Medical News Today, 2025).\n\n**Resources:**  \n- [Medical News Today: 10 Tips to Lose Weight](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/303409)\n\n#### 4. Get Active, Stay Active  \nRegular exercise complements your diet and supports weight loss. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity weekly. Strength training should also be included at least twice a week. Even small changes, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator or participating in physical activities you enjoy, can contribute to your fitness goals (Everyday Health, 2025).\n\n**Resources:**  \n- [Everyday Health: 24 Tips for Weight Loss](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-and-nutrition/diet/tips-weight-loss-actually-work/)\n\n#### 5. Meal Planning  \nPlanning your meals ahead can help maintain a balanced diet and control portion sizes. When meals are prepared in advance, it simplifies grocery shopping and minimizes the risk of opting for unhealthy convenience foods. A recent study highlighted that meal planning is more frequently used by successful weight-loss maintainers (PMC, 2025).\n\n**Resources:**  \n- [PMC: Meal Planning and Weight Loss](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5288891/)\n\n---\n\n#### Conclusion  \nWeight loss is a journey that requires commitment, patience, and a multifaceted approach. By understanding your motivation, setting realistic goals, keeping a food diary, incorporating regular physical activity, and planning your meals, you can pave the way to a healthier you. Remember, every small step counts in reaching your weight loss goals!  \n\n---\n\n### AI-Generated Image of Healthy Meals  \n![Healthy Meals](https://www.recraft.ai/generate/food)  \n\n#### PDF Download  \nThe complete article has been prepared and saved into a PDF.

Excellent courses in stunning settings, a mild climate all year round and the friendly welcome given to golfers. \nIt’s hard to find a better destination for a golfing holiday. Chosen by the World Golf Awards as the Best Golf Destination in Europe for six years in a row, between 2014 and 2019, and again in 2021 and 2023, as well as the Best Golf Destination in the World between 2014 and 2018, and again in 2023, Portugal has a wide variety of courses, with features suitable for the different levels of difficulty and the available budget.\nThere are more than ninety courses around the country, with varied courses and great golf challenges, recognized by the most experienced golf professionals.\n\nPhoto: Quinta do Lago Sul, Algarve ©Shutterstock\nMany of the courses were designed by famous architects such as Robert Trent Jones Jr., Jack Nicklaus, Arthur Hills, Nick Faldo, Severiano Ballesteros, Henry Cotton, Rocky Roquemore and Arnold Palmer, the creator of the award-winning Victoria Golf Course, one of golf's flagship courses, where the Portugal Masters has been held since it was first staged in 2007. One thing they all share is their environmental quality and the harmonious way in which they blend into the natural surroundings.\n\nPhoto: Clube de Golfe Quinta da Marinha, Cascais, Lisboa\nThe Algarve and the Lisbon coast are well-known destinations for more experienced players and have won several international awards. They host major competitions on the professional tours, as does Madeira with its mountain courses. In the Azores, there's also rustic golf that is played in a rural setting.

The Canary Islands boast an average annual temperature of over 20 degrees Celsius. And areas in southern Andalusia enjoy around 3,000 hours of sunshine every year. The Mediterranean regions of Catalonia, Valencia and Murcia have mild temperatures in winter... Spain’s weather conditions guarantee a very long golf season.\nMarbella, the golf capital of Europe \nWorld-renowned destinations\nMarbellais the golf capital of Europe.

In general, the south of Andalusia is highly appreciated by golf enthusiasts and there are many well-known clubs around Malaga and on the Costa de Luz (in Cadiz and Huelva). The Costa Bravaarea (in Catalonia), the Costa Cálida (in the Region of Murcia) and the Region of Valencia also have interesting options, in addition to the Canary and Balearic Islands. \nGolf in Tenerife © Turismo de Tenerife \nOutstanding international connections\nThe locations of the main golf areas are perfect if you want to organise a short trip, because they are close to airports with numerous international connections. Malaga, Alicante, Barcelona, Girona and Madrid airports are very close to major golf courses and make it possible to plan a getaway from almost any country in Europe.\nLeft: Sheraton Salobre Golf Gran Canaria / right: Cabanillas Golf Club (Castilla-La Mancha) © Izqda: Turismo de Canarias \nVariety of courses in different environments\nDepending on your tastes, your holiday destination, the circumstances... In Spain you can choose between very different golf courses throughout the whole country. You can find them overlooking the sea, in rural areas, amidst mountains, and even in big cities.\nPlaying golf as a family \nYou can combine golfing with anything you or your travel companion like\nDo you like good food? Do you enjoy art and culture? Do you love to relax in spas? Do you prefer accommodation with character? In Spain, you’ll have no problem combining golf with these pleasures for various reasons. For example, the Costa del Sol, Costa de la Luz and Costa Brava areas boast a wide range of restaurants with Michelin Stars, and the regions in general have delicious local cuisine. In other areas such as Navarre, golf can be combined with gourmet gastronomy. If you are keen on combining golf with culture, you can do so by playing in cities such as Madrid and Barcelona or even in the vicinity of one of the 15 World Heritage Cities. The main golf courses are often found in luxury resorts, and the paradors of Malaga and El Saler have outstanding golf courses. Another option? Kick back in a spa like the one on the island of La Toja (Galicia), and check out its amazing golf course, in a privileged setting.\nEl Saler Golf Course in Valencia (Region of Valencia) \nCourses by great designers\nMany of the best golf course architects are responsible for the design of the courses you can play on in Spain. For example, the courses at the Club de Golf Valderrama and Real Club Sotogrande (both on the Costa de la Luz) are the work of Robert Trent Jones. Cabell Robinson designed the Finca El Cortesín Golf Club (in Costa del Sol) and La Reserva de Sotogrande (Costa de la Luz). Former golfer Neil Coles is behind the PGA Catalunya Resort (Girona), and Javier Arana has worked on the El Saler Golf Course (region of Valencia) and Aloha Golf (Marbella). In Cantabria, you can even play in the Real Golf de Pedreña, where Spanish champion Severiano Ballesteros assisted in the design.\nAlcaidesa Links Golf Course in La Línea de la Concepción (Cadiz) \nCourses for all levels\nSpain hosts international tournaments and many professionals choose to train here. However, Spain also offers options for any amateur or first-time golfer.

      "output": "# The Passion and History of Scottish Football\n\nScottish football is steeped in history, tradition, and passionate rivalries, making it a significant pillar of Scotland’s cultural identity. Dating back to the Middle Ages, the game has evolved from chaotic and often violent altercations to a well-structured and highly competitive sport appreciated worldwide.\n\n## Early History of Scottish Football\n\nThe origins of football in Scotland are somewhat murky, with early forms appearing in the Middle Ages. Historical records indicate that games of football were outlawed multiple times, starting with King James I’s Football Act of 1424, due to the violence and chaos they often incited. By the sixteenth century, the rough nature of the games remained a concern. Players would routinely suffer injuries, and local municipalities attempted to ban the sport on numerous occasions to maintain peace and order.\n\nAccording to historical accounts, even schoolchildren participated in early versions of the game, which noted rough play akin to today’s rugby. These early encounters often ended in injuries, leading to a persistent narrative of football as a dangerous spectator sport.\n\n## Development of Organized Football\n\nThe modern era of Scottish football took off in the late 19th century when formalized clubs and competitions began to emerge. The Scottish Cup, initiated in the 1873–74 season, is the second oldest football competition globally. In 1890, the establishment of the Scottish Football League signified the beginning of structured league play. Rangers and Celtic, two of the most storied clubs in Scottish football, have dominated the league, garnering numerous titles over the years.\n\n### Notable Achievements\n- **Celtic**: Won the European Cup in 1967, becoming the first British club to do so. Celtic Park, their home ground, is known for its electric atmosphere and massive support.\n- **Rangers**: With an impressive haul of 55 league titles, they remain a formidable force and have enjoyed success in European competitions too, reaching the UEFA Europa League final in 2022.\n\n## The Old Firm Rivalry\n\nOne cannot discuss Scottish football without mentioning the fierce rivalry between Celtic and Rangers, collectively known as the Old Firm. This rivalry extends beyond the pitch, encompassing socio-cultural and political dimensions that resonate deeply within Scottish society. Matches between these two clubs are some of the most anticipated events, attracting massive crowds and worldwide viewership.\n\nThe matches are often characterized by intense emotions, vibrant displays from fans, and a spirited atmosphere, encapsulating the passion and fervor of Scottish football. It is reported that both clubs have a combined total of approximately 238 major honors, dominating the upper echelons of Scottish football.\n\n## Current Trends in Scottish Football\n\nAs of 2023, Scottish football is witnessing a renaissance, with a surge in attendances and broader European engagement. Clubs are investing in youth development and infrastructure, aiming for sustainable success on both domestic and international levels. Women’s football, in particular, has gained prominence, with teams like Glasgow City and Rangers Women leading the charge in the Scottish Women’s Premier League. Investments in women's facilities and nurturing local talent are beginning to reshape the landscape.\n\n### Recent Developments\n- The current 2023/24 Scottish Premiership is heating up, with clubs like Celtic and Rangers vying for the title once more. \n- Significant fixtures continue to attract global attention, showcasing the league's competitiveness and vibrancy.\n- Youth academies across various clubs are gaining recognition as nurturing grounds for talent, focusing on developing homegrown players to compete at higher levels.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nScottish football remains an emblem of national pride, steeped in deep-seated history and characterized by fierce rivalries and passionate supporters. As the game continues to evolve, blending tradition with modern practices, it retains its significance within the cultural and social framework of Scotland.\n\nFor both the players and fans, the beautiful game is more than just a sport; it's a shared heritage that continues to unite communities across the nation.\n\n![Scottish Football Match](/skill-images/img_1771632319006_q47y4p.png)\n\n---\n\n### [Download PDF](/skill-pdfs/scottish_football_article_1771632361140_ux4atg.pdf) - Scottish Football: A Legacy of Passion and Rivalry",

              "text": "History of football in Scotland\nThis article details the history of football in Scotland. \nEarly history (pre 1867)\n[edit]\nThe football origins in Scotland are uncertain. Early forms of it were played in England[1] and France. Games of \"football\" were played in Scotland in the Middle Ages, but medieval football bears little resemblance to association football (soccer). The ball could be carried by hand, and teams were sometimes of dozens of players or more, with scrummaging involved. Some of these games are still played, notably in Kirkwall and Jedburgh – see Ba game. \nThe earliest reference to \"fute-ball\" in Scotland was in 1424 when King James I outlawed it in the Football Act 1424. Subsequent kings issued similar decrees, suggesting that the bans were unsuccessful. Certainly James VI of Scotland was well aware of the violent nature of football, writing in his 1599 Basilikon Doron, to debar from commendable exercise \"all rough and violent exercises, as the foot-ball, meeter for laming than making able the users thereof\".[2][3] There were also times when royalty played the games themselves, with the accounts of the Lord High Treasurer in 1497 mentioning the purchase of footballs for James IV. There is also a tradition that King James V visited Jedburgh to play in the ball game there, although there is no evidence of this happening. \nViolence in early Scottish football games was certainly an important reason for these royal decrees and further evidence comes from sixteenth century Scottish literature, for example in the following poems. \nBetween 1501 and 1512 Gavin Douglas states: \n\"This broken shin that swells and will not be relieved, Take it to him; he broke it at ball, And tell him it will be his reward. Take the whole of this bruised arm to him\" \nSir Richard Maitland expresses his pleasure in a late sixteenth century poem at being too old for the rough game: \nQuhen zoung men cummis fra the gren, Playand at the futball had bein, with broken spauld, I thank my god I want ein, I am so auld\".[3]\nIn modern English can be translated as: \nWhen young men come from the green Had been playing football With broken shoulder, I thank my God that I lack eyesight: I am so old\nThe violence of early football in Scotland is also described vividly by another anonymous sixteenth century description, \"The Beauties of Foot-ball\": \nBrissit, brawnis and broken banis, Stryf, discorde and waistie wanis, Cruikit in eild syn halt withall, Thir are the bewties of the fute ball\".[3]\nThis in modern English is translated as: \nBruised muscles and broken bones Strife, Discord, and futile blows Lamed in old age, then crippled withal These are the beauties of football\"\nIt was not just the Scottish monarchy and local municipalities that passed laws on the playing of football. In Perth, apprentices progressing to become master craftsmen in the sixteenth century traditionally had to pay for a banquet and hold a football match.[4] In 1546 the Company of Hammermen (i.e. smiths) of Perth issued a decree that \"neither servants nor apprentices\" should play football \"under penalty of a pound of wax\" to be given to their altar in the church.[5] Presumably this was a measure to prevent work absences and injuries. There are other accounts of employers trying to ban football in Scotland over the following centuries. \nEarly Scottish football sometimes erupted into violence, including the use of firearms. At Lochtoun in 1606 during a \"fute-ball\" match some players \"fell in contentioun and controversie, ilk anie with otheris, and schot and dilaschit pistolettis and hacquebuttis\"[3] It was clearly a passionate and dangerous pastime. Football in the sixteenth century is also documented as being a pretext for raids across the border against the English. \nIn an attempt to control such violent outbursts, and for religious reasons, football came under Puritan attack in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It became an offence to play on a Sunday, with the youth of Aberdeen, for example, accused in 1607 of conducting themselves profanely on the Sabbath: \"drinking, playing football... and roving from parish to parish\"[6] Further references to this offence come at the end of the sixteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth. In 1656 the Scottish Parliament passed an act outlawing all boisterous games on the Lord's day. Nevertheless, the Puritan attack on football was not as severe in Scotland as it was in England and continued to be played enthusiastically. \nThere is evidence that schoolboys played a ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable some consider that it mentions passing the ball. The word \"pass\" is derived from \"huc percute\" (strike it here) and later \"repercute pilam\" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. The original word translated as \"goal\" is \"metum\", literally meaning the \"pillar at each end of the circus course\" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to \"get hold of the ball before [another player] does\" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. The original 1930 translation states \"Throw yourself against him\" (Age, objice te illi). It is clear that the game was rough and that tackles were allowed, included \"charging\" and pushing/holding of opposing players (\"drive that man back\" in the original translation, \"repelle eum\" in original Latin). It has been suggested that this game bears similarities to rugby football. \nViolence continued to be a regular complaint about Scottish football games for many centuries. Sir Patrick Hume of Polwarth wrote to his wife in March 1648 that their son \"hurt himself so evill at football in Polwart upon Sunday that he was not able to sturre\". In Jedburgh the ball game was outlawed by the town council in 1704 because \"sometimes both old and young near lost their lives thereby\".[3] As a result, it was decided to \"discharge the game now and all time coming\". However, even in 1706, local trades at Jedburgh were cooperating trying to suppress the game, as shown by the Fleshers' Corporation's fining of some members for \"rastling at the football\".[5] Similarly at Duns in 1724 a complaint reads: \"football... did always end and determine in the effusion of blood among the inhabitants\".[3] Toward the end of the eighteenth century the poet Skinner noted in his poems some of the injuries sustained playing foortball in Monymusk: \"Has ne’er in Monymusk been seen Sae mony weel-beft skins; Of a' the ba'-men there was nane But had twa bleedy shins\" \nSir Walter Scott described football as \"his favourite border sport\". He too, however, talks about the rough nature of nineteenth century Scottish football in \"the Lay\": \"In riot, revelry, and rout, Pursued the football, play\".[3] Scott also states that in the \"foot-ball...The victory is contested with the utmost fury, and very serious accidents have sometimes taken place in the struggle\". \nScottish football continued to be a very violent affair well into the nineteenth century. For, example the game in Hawick was described in 1825 as \"a species of war or fighting\".[3] In 1826 the game was banned in Kirkwall as it was disturbing the peace. From this time until the late 1860s there is a lull in references to football in Scotland, suggested that banning of the game had at last proved successful. As a result of the level of violence often seen in early Scottish football games, a lot of traditional ball games were modified or died out in the nineteenth century. Examples still exist today, however, of traditional Scottish football, in particular the Ba game (although many of these have been revived in the modern time). \nThe earliest evidence of the use of codified rules of any type of football in Scotland came in 1851 when rugby football was adopted by the Edinburgh Academy, in order to be able to play with other schools. The Edinburgh Academical Football Club, is the oldest football club of any code in Scotland (rugby footbal",

It lists every Scottish football club to have won any of the four major domestic trophies, six major European competitions which have existed at different times, or the two global competitions FIFA has recognised. These honours consist of the Scottish football championship—the Scottish Football League up to 1998, Scottish Premier League from 1998 to 2013 and the Scottish Professional Football League thereafter—the Scottish Cup, the League Cup, the Champions League or its predecessor the European Cup, the now-defunct European Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Europa League or its predecessors the UEFA Cup and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup or its predecessor the Intercontinental Cup. \nCompetitive football started in Scotland with the Scottish Cup, the second oldest football competition in the world, which was first held in the 1873–74 season. League football followed when the Scottish Football League was founded in 1890, with Dumbarton and Rangers sharing the first title. The Scottish Football League remained the highest division of the Scottish football league system until 1998, when the Scottish Premier League was founded. The Scottish Football League also added a second major cup competition in 1946, when it founded the League Cup, invititation to which is restricted to the 42 members of the league. Rangers have won a record number of League Cups, while Celtic have won a record number of Scottish Cups. Both have achieved 55 League title wins. \nEuropean competition started in 1955 with the European Cup and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, which was succeeded by the UEFA Cup for the 1971–72 season. The Cup Winners' Cup followed in 1960 but was discontinued in 1999. Three Scottish teams have lifted at least one European trophy. Celtic won the European Cup in 1967, Rangers won the Cup Winners' Cup in 1972 and Aberdeen won the Cup Winners' Cup and Super Cup in 1983. Intercontinental competition started in 1960 with the Intercontinental Cup, which consisted of a two-legged tie between the European Cup and the South American Copa Libertadores winners from 1960 to 1979. To date, Celtic are the only Scottish club to participate in an intercontinental competition, losing the 1967 Intercontinental Cup to Racing Club.[1] \nKey\nAs of 24 May 2025\nRank Club League SC LC UCL CWC USC Total Last trophy \n1 \tCeltic \t55 \t42 \t22 \t0 \t1 \t0 \t0 \t120 \t2024–25 Scottish Premiership \t\n2 \tRangers \t55 \t34 \t28 \t0 \t0 \t1 \t0 \t118 \t2023–24 Scottish League Cup \t\n3 \tAberdeen \t4 \t8 \t6 \t0 \t0 \t1 \t1 \t20 \t2024–25 Scottish Cup \t\n4 \tHeart of Midlothian \t4 \t8 \t4 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t16 \t2011–12 Scottish Cup \t\n5 \tQueen's Park \t0 \t10 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t10 \t1892–93 Scottish Cup \t\nHibernian \t4 \t3 \t3 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t10 \t2015–16 Scottish Cup \t\n7 \tDundee \t1 \t1 \t3 \t2 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t7 \t2009–10 Scottish Challenge Cup \t\n8 \tDundee United \t1 \t2 \t2 \t1 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t6 \t2016–17 Scottish Challenge Cup \t\nSt Mirren \t0 \t3 \t2 \t1 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t6 \t2025–26 Scottish League Cup \t\nFalkirk \t0 \t2 \t0 \t4 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t6 \t2011–12 Scottish Challenge Cup \t\n11 \tKilmarnock \t1 \t3 \t1 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t5 \t2011–12 Scottish League Cup \t\n12 \tMotherwell \t1 \t2 \t1 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t4 \t1990–91 Scottish Cup \t\nSt Johnstone \t0 \t2 \t1 \t1 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t4 \t2020–21 Scottish Cup \t\nEast Fife \t0 \t1 \t3 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t4 \t1953–54 Scottish League Cup \t\nAirdrieonians (1878) \t0 \t1 \t0 \t3 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t4 \t2000–01 Scottish Challenge Cup \t\nInverness Caledonian Thistle \t0 \t1 \t0 \t3 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t4 \t2019–20 Scottish Challenge Cup \t\nRoss County \t0 \t0 \t1 \t3 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t4 \t2018–19 Scottish Challenge Cup \t\nRaith Rovers \t0 \t0 \t1 \t3 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t4 \t2021–22 Scottish Challenge Cup \t\n19 \tDumbarton \t2 \t1 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t3 \t1891–92 Scottish Football League \t\nThird Lanark \t1 \t2 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t3 \t1904–05 Scottish Cup \t\nVale of Leven \t0 \t3 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t3 \t1878–79 Scottish Cup \t\nClyde \t0 \t3 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t3 \t1957–58 Scottish Cup \t\nLivingston \t0 \t0 \t1 \t2 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t3 \t2024–25 Scottish Challenge Cup \t\nHamilton Academical \t0 \t0 \t0 \t3 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t3 \t2022–23 Scottish Challenge Cup \t\n25 \tRenton \t0 \t2 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t2 \t1887–88 Scottish Cup \t\nDunfermline Athletic \t0 \t2 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t2 \t1967–68 Scottish Cup \t\nPartick Thistle \t0 \t1 \t1 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t2 \t1971–72 Scottish League Cup \t\n30 \tSt Bernard's \t0 \t1 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t1 \t1894–95 Scottish Cup \t\nGreenock Morton \t0 \t1 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t0 \t1 \t1921–22 Scottish Cup \t\nList of Scottish Cup finals\nList of Scottish League Cup finals\nList of Scottish football champions\n^ \"NOW YOU KNOW: Celtic lost 1-0 in the Battle of Montevideo\".

This vibrant football culture is largely driven by two of the best-supported clubs in Scottish and British football: Rangers and Celtic. \nThese clubs, known collectively as the Old Firm, have a fierce rivalry that dates back over a century. The two are the most successful clubs in Scotland by a significant margin, and the two tend to share the honours in the country. \nThe best Football tutors available\n5 (27 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (32 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (38 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (16 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (16 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (16 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (10 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (17 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (27 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (32 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (38 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (16 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (16 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (16 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (10 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (17 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\nLet's go\nGlasgow's Football Teams\nThere are 4 professional football teams based in Glasgow: Rangers and Celtics (which together make up the Old Firm). More recent clubs include Patrick Thistle and Queen's Park. All clubs are part of the Scottish professional league system. \nThere are a lot of clubs around the country, of course, and Edinburgh has more football clubs with rich histories and some big rivalries, but the Glasgow Derby is known all over the world, and rivals anything in world football.\nEven the rivalries in London's football clubs and the North West of England are not usually as fierce and may not be as well-attended as these Old Firm games. \nRangers Football Club, founded in 1872, is one of the oldest football clubs in Scotland. \n⚽️ 55 Scottish League Titles\n🏆 34 Scottish Cups \n🥇 27 Scottish League Cups\nWith a record 55 Scottish League titles, 34 Scottish Cups, and 27 Scottish League Cups, Rangers are one of the most successful clubs in the world by many peoples’ metrics. \nTheir home, Ibrox Stadium, has been a fortress where many memorable matches have taken place. Ibrox is also the name of a suburb of Glasgow, Scotland, South of the river Clyde, and this is where the club is based. More than 50,000 people flock to the stadium to watch their beloved club.\nCrucially, Rangers play in blue and white, which is a stark difference to rivals Celtic. A bit like clubs in the North West or other football hubs in the UK, fans are keen to show their colours and who they support.\nIbrox Stadium, the home of Glasgow Rangers. Image by Winston Tjia \nThe club's most notable period came under the management of Bill Struth, who led Rangers to numerous league titles and cups. More recently, Steven Gerrard's tenure saw Rangers reclaim the Scottish Premiership title in the 2020-2021 season, ending Celtic's long dominance.\nRising From the Ashes\nGlasgow Rangers went into receivership and had to start again in the Scottish 3rd division following a debt crisis. This effectively meant that the team had to start again after a spell of being in the top flight. They lost some hugely important players, and though they retained their massive fanbase, Rangers’ comeback was impressive. \nIn recent years, Rangers have not only re-established their dominance in Scottish football but also made significant strides in European competitions. They reached the 2022 UEFA Europa League final where they took Eintracht Frankfurt to penalties where they ultimately lost to the German team. \nRangers Women\nRangers Women have been making significant progress since their formation. Initially playing a more modest role in Scottish women's football, they have seen substantial growth in investment and development, paralleling the men's team’s success.\nThe women's team has been competing in the Scottish Women's Premier League (SWPL), with notable improvements in their performance each season. The club's focus on youth development and professional training facilities has started to yield results, with Rangers Women now regularly challenging for top honours and having senior international players.\nThe introduction of full-time professional contracts has been a game-changer, allowing the team to attract and retain top talent. This commitment to the women's game reflects a broader trend in Scottish football, where women's teams are gaining increased support and recognition.\nUse social media platforms to ask for recommendations on \"football training near me\" from local communities.\nThe best Football tutors available\n5 (27 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (32 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (38 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (16 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (16 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (16 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (10 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (17 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (27 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (32 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (38 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (16 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (16 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (16 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (10 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\n5 (17 reviews)\n1st lesson free!\nLet's go\nCeltic FC\nCeltic Football Club, founded in 1887, has a history that revolves around Scotland’s Irish community, which is absolutely huge. \n+50 \nScottish League Titles\nTheir home ground, Celtic Park, often referred to as Parkhead, is known for its electric atmosphere. 60,000 people pack into the stadium for the big games and the stadium is iconic for European nights where it is laden with green and white (the colours of Celtic), though the club does not see as much success as the London or Manchester football clubs.\nBrendan Rodgers, Image by Werner100359\nOne of Celtic's most significant achievements came in 1967 when they became the first British club to win the European Cup, under the management of Jock Stein. This legendary team, known as the \"Lisbon Lions,\" remains a source of pride for the club and its supporters and the tales have been passed on through the generations.\nIt is fair to say that since the turn of the century, Celtic have been the most successful team in the country by a mile. \nIn the past decade, Celtic has dominated Scottish Premiership football, winning nine consecutive league titles from 2012 to 2020. Under the guidance of managers like Brendan Rodgers and Neil Lennon, Celtic also enjoyed considerable success in domestic cup competitions and made respectable runs in European tournaments.\nLisbon Lions\nMaking history: the Lisbon Lions is the nickname given to the Celtic team that managed to win the European Cup at the Estádio Nacional in Lisbon, Portugal on 25 May 1967. They were the first British team to win it.\nCeltic Women\nCeltic Women have been a key player in the development of women's football in Scotland. Celtic Women have enjoyed success in the SWPL, consistently finishing near the top of the table and competing for major honours, winning it once and finishing second four times. The club's commitment to the women's team is evident in their investment in facilities, coaching, and player development.\nThe women's team has also participated in the UEFA Women's Champions League, gaining valuable experience and exposure on the European stage. This involvement not only boosts the team's profile but also helps raise the standard of women's football in Scotland.\nWith a personal football trainer, you benefit from focused repetition of key techniques, enhancing your muscle memory and on-field performance.\nGlasgow City Women\nGlasgow has some parallels with London clubs, and like London clubs, there are teams that compete in the women’s game that don’t compete in the men’s. \nFounded in 1998, Glasgow City Women is a dominant team for women in Glasgow, providing competitive opportunities for female footballers. The club quickly grew to dominate the Scottish Women's Premier League (SWPL). Glasgow City Women have secured multiple league titles and Scottish Cups, demonstrating consistent excellence and ambition.\nThe club",

            "content": "# The Passion and History of Scottish Football\n\nScottish football is steeped in history, tradition, and passionate rivalries, making it a significant pillar of Scotland’s cultural identity. Dating back to the Middle Ages, the game has evolved from chaotic and often violent altercations to a well-structured and highly competitive sport appreciated worldwide.\n\n## Early History of Scottish Football\n\nThe origins of football in Scotland are somewhat murky, with early forms appearing in the Middle Ages. Historical records indicate that games of football were outlawed multiple times, starting with King James I’s Football Act of 1424, due to the violence and chaos they often incited. By the sixteenth century, the rough nature of the games remained a concern. Players would routinely suffer injuries, and local municipalities attempted to ban the sport on numerous occasions to maintain peace and order.\n\nAccording to historical accounts, even schoolchildren participated in early versions of the game, which noted rough play akin to today’s rugby. These early encounters often ended in injuries, leading to a persistent narrative of football as a dangerous spectator sport.\n\n## Development of Organized Football\n\nThe modern era of Scottish football took off in the late 19th century when formalized clubs and competitions began to emerge. The Scottish Cup, initiated in the 1873–74 season, is the second oldest football competition globally. In 1890, the establishment of the Scottish Football League signified the beginning of structured league play. Rangers and Celtic, two of the most storied clubs in Scottish football, have dominated the league, garnering numerous titles over the years.\n\n### Notable Achievements\n- **Celtic**: Won the European Cup in 1967, becoming the first British club to do so. Celtic Park, their home ground, is known for its electric atmosphere and massive support.\n- **Rangers**: With an impressive haul of 55 league titles, they remain a formidable force and have enjoyed success in European competitions too, reaching the UEFA Europa League final in 2022.\n\n## The Old Firm Rivalry\n\nOne cannot discuss Scottish football without mentioning the fierce rivalry between Celtic and Rangers, collectively known as the Old Firm. This rivalry extends beyond the pitch, encompassing socio-cultural and political dimensions that resonate deeply within Scottish society. Matches between these two clubs are some of the most anticipated events, attracting massive crowds and worldwide viewership.\n\nThe matches are often characterized by intense emotions, vibrant displays from fans, and a spirited atmosphere, encapsulating the passion and fervor of Scottish football.  It is reported that both clubs have a combined total of approximately 238 major honors, dominating the upper echelons of Scottish football.\n\n## Current Trends in Scottish Football\n\nAs of 2023, Scottish football is witnessing a renaissance, with a surge in attendances and broader European engagement. Clubs are investing in youth development and infrastructure, aiming for sustainable success on both domestic and international levels. Women’s football, in particular, has gained prominence, with teams like Glasgow City and Rangers Women leading the charge in the Scottish Women’s Premier League. Investments in women's facilities and nurturing local talent are beginning to reshape the landscape.\n\n### Recent Developments\n- The current 2023/24 Scottish Premiership is heating up, with clubs like Celtic and Rangers vying for the title once more. \n- Significant fixtures continue to attract global attention, showcasing the league's competitiveness and vibrancy.\n- Youth academies across various clubs are gaining recognition as nurturing grounds for talent, focusing on developing homegrown players to compete at higher levels.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nScottish football remains an emblem of national pride, steeped in deep-seated history and characterized by fierce rivalries and passionate supporters. As the game continues to evolve, blending tradition with modern practices, it retains its significance within the cultural and social framework of Scotland.\n\nFor both the players and fans, the beautiful game is more than just a sport; it's a shared heritage that continues to unite communities across the nation.\n\n![](https://skill-images.img_1771632319006_q47y4p.png)",

      "prompt": "You are an expert in LLM-optimized content - content designed to be cited by AI search engines like Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, Google AI Overviews, and Bing Copilot.\n\n## Your Process\n1. **Research Phase**: Use brave-search 3-4 times to understand the topic landscape, what questions people ask, and what current top sources cover\n2. **Writing Phase**: Write the article using every LLM optimization technique below\n3. **Image Phase**: Generate a relevant hero image\n4. **PDF Phase**: If the user asks to save/export as PDF, use generate-pdf with the final article\n\n## LLM Content Optimization - MANDATORY Sections & Techniques\n\n### 1. DIRECT ANSWER BLOCK (first 100 words)\n- Open with a concise, factual direct answer to the core question\n- LLMs pull from the first paragraph heavily - make it quotable\n- Format: \"[Topic] is/means [direct definition/answer]. [One supporting sentence with a data point].\"\n- This becomes the snippet LLMs cite\n\n### 2. KEY FACTS / AT A GLANCE BOX\n- Immediately after the intro, include a structured summary:\n`\n## Key Facts\n- **What**: [one-line definition]\n- **Why it matters**: [one-line impact]\n- **Key stat**: [most compelling data point with source]\n- **Last updated**: [current date]\n- **Bottom line**: [one-sentence takeaway]\n`\n\n### 3. TABLE OF CONTENTS\n- Include a markdown TOC with all H2 headings\n- LLMs use this to understand article structure\n\n### 4. QUESTION-BASED H2 HEADINGS\n- Every section heading should be a natural language question people actually ask\n- Example: \"## What Is [Topic]?\" not \"## Overview\"\n- Example: \"## How Does [Topic] Work?\" not \"## Functionality\"\n- Example: \"## What Are the Benefits of [Topic]?\" not \"## Benefits\"\n- LLMs match these to user queries\n\n### 5. STRUCTURED ANSWER PATTERN (for each section)\nEach section MUST follow this pattern:\n- **First sentence**: Direct answer to the heading question (quotable)\n- **Supporting paragraph**: Evidence, data, examples (2-3 sentences)\n- **Bullet points or numbered list**: Key details broken out\n- **Expert quote or data point**: Authority signal\n- LLMs prefer this structure because it's easy to extract\n\n### 6. COMPARISON TABLE\n- Include at least one markdown comparison table\n- Tables are heavily cited by LLMs for comparative queries\n- Example: comparing approaches, tools, pros/cons, before/after\n\n### 7. FAQ SECTION (CRITICAL)\n- Include 5-8 FAQs at the end in this exact format:\n`\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### [Question]?\n[2-3 sentence direct answer.]\n\n### [Question]?\n[2-3 sentence direct answer.]\n`\n- These map directly to \"People Also Ask\" and LLM follow-up queries\n- Each answer should be self-contained (quotable without context)\n\n### 8. STATISTICS & DATA POINTS\n- Include at least 5 specific stats/numbers throughout\n- Always cite the source: \"According to [Source], [stat] ([Year])\"\n- LLMs heavily favor content with verifiable data points\n- Use the most recent data available from your research\n\n### 9. DEFINITIONS & TERMINOLOGY\n- Define key terms inline using bold: **Term** - definition\n- LLMs pull these for definitional queries\n\n### 10. AUTHORITY SIGNALS\n- Mention specific sources by name (named experts, organizations, studies)\n- Use phrases like \"According to\", \"Research from [X] shows\", \"Experts at [Y] recommend\"\n- Include source URLs - LLMs check for citations\n\n### 11. FRESHNESS SIGNALS\n- Mention the current year and date where relevant\n- Use phrases like \"As of 2026\", \"The latest data shows\"\n- Reference recent developments from your research\n\n### 12. STRUCTURED CONCLUSION\n- Summarize in bullet points (not prose)\n- Include a \"Key Takeaways\" section:\n`\n## Key Takeaways\n- [Takeaway 1]\n- [Takeaway 2]\n- [Takeaway 3]\n`\n\n### 13. SCHEMA-FRIENDLY METADATA (at the very end)\nInclude this block:\n`\n---\n**Article Metadata**\n- Topic: [primary topic]\n- Primary Query: [main question this answers]\n- Related Queries: [3-5 related questions]\n- Last Updated: [date]\n- Content Type: [guide/comparison/explainer/how-to]\n- Word Count: [approximate]\n---\n`\n\n## Content Rules\n- Write 1500-2500 words (longer content gets more LLM citations)\n- Every claim should have a source or data point\n- Use simple, clear language - LLMs prefer low complexity for citation\n- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)\n- Heavy use of formatting: bold, lists, tables, headers\n- No fluff - every sentence should add information value\n- Cite sources inline with URLs from your research",

Generate a suite of social media posts optimised for each platform\n\n## Output Format\n\nFor each target platform, generate 3-5 posts:\n\n### LinkedIn Posts\n- Professional tone, thought-leadership angle\n- 150-300 words for long posts, 50-100 for short\n- Include a hook in the first line (pattern-interrupt or bold statement)\n- Use line breaks for readability\n- End with a question or CTA to drive engagement\n- Suggest relevant hashtags (3-5)\n\n### Twitter/X Posts\n- Under 280 characters\n- Punchy, quotable, shareable\n- Generate a thread option (5-7 tweets) for deeper content\n- Include relevant hashtags (1-2)\n\n### Facebook Posts\n- Conversational, relatable tone\n- 100-200 words\n- Storytelling angle where possible\n- End with a question to drive comments\n\n### Instagram Captions\n- Engaging opening line (no hashtags in first line)\n- 100-200 words\n- Suggest image/carousel concept for each post\n- Hashtag block at the end (10-15 hashtags)\n\n## Content Calendar\nAfter all posts, provide a suggested posting schedule:\n| Day | Platform | Post Summary |\n|-----|----------|-------------|\n\n## Rules\n- NEVER copy-paste from the original — rewrite and reformat for each platform\n- Each post should stand alone (someone seeing just that post should understand it)\n- Vary the angles — don't make every post say the same thing differently\n- Include a mix of: educational, provocative/opinion, data-driven, story-based\n- If a statistic or quote from the original is compelling, use it as the hook\n- If the user asks to save as PDF, use the generate-pdf tool",

Given any incoming item (email, support ticket, document, form response, message), you classify it into categories and provide routing instructions.\n\n## Your Process\n1. Read the incoming item carefully\n2. If categories are provided by the user, classify into those. Otherwise, auto-detect the most appropriate categories.\n3. Assess priority and urgency\n4. Provide a routing recommendation\n\n## Output Format\n\n### Classification\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| **Primary Category** | [category name] |\n| **Secondary Category** | [if applicable] |\n| **Confidence** | High / Medium / Low |\n| **Priority** | Critical / High / Medium / Low |\n| **Urgency** | Immediate / Same-day / Standard / No rush |\n\n### Key Entities Extracted\n- **Person/Company**: [who is this from/about]\n- **Topic**: [what is this about]\n- **Intent**: [what do they want — question, complaint, request, information, purchase, etc.]\n- **Monetary Value**: [if any amounts mentioned]\n- **Deadline**: [if any dates/deadlines mentioned]\n\n### Routing Recommendation\n- **Route to**: [team/person/queue]\n- **Action**: [respond, escalate, file, forward, auto-acknowledge]\n- **Reasoning**: [why this routing was chosen]\n\n### Auto-Response Suggestion\nIf appropriate, suggest a brief auto-response the sender should receive (e.g., acknowledgement, expected timeline).\n\n## When Categories Are Provided\nIf the user provides a list of categories in the `categories` input, you MUST classify into one of those categories. If none fit well, use the closest match and note the poor fit.\n\nExample categories input: `billing, technical-support, sales-enquiry, complaint, spam, general`\n\n## Rules\n- Be decisive — always pick a primary category, even if confidence is medium\n- Extract entities that would help the recipient act faster\n- If the item contains multiple topics, note the primary and secondary\n- For ambiguous items, explain your reasoning\n- If the user passes multiple items (batch), produce a summary table\n- If the user asks to save as PDF, use the generate-pdf tool",
