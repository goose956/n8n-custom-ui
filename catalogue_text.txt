High-Impact Skill Catalogue for an AI 
Skill-Based Platform
Overview
This document presents 20 carefully selected skills designed for maximum cross-industry 
reusability. Each skill is classified by its primary category (Input, Processing, or Output), the 
industries it serves, and the specific job to be done it addresses. The guiding principle is 
composability: these skills should snap together like building blocks so that an accountant, 
a recruiter, a marketer, and a logistics manager can all assemble workflows from the same 
shared library.
The skills are ordered to move roughly from ingestion (getting data in), through processing 
(transforming, analysing, enriching), to output (delivering a finished artefact). This mirrors 
the natural anatomy of any workflow.

Detailed Skill Descriptions
INPUT SKILLS — Getting Data In
1. Email Ingest & Parse
Category: Input
Input: Raw email (subject, body, attachments)
Output: Structured JSON fields (sender, date, intent, key entities, attachment references)
Job to be done: "I receive information via email and need it extracted into a usable format 
so the rest of my workflow can act on it."
Why this is high-impact: Email remains the universal business inbox. Every industry — 
from a solicitor receiving case updates, to an e-commerce store getting supplier invoices, to 
a recruiter receiving CVs — starts workflows from an email. A skill that can ingest an email, 
identify its intent (invoice, enquiry, complaint, application), pull out key fields, and hand off 
structured data is the single most reusable entry point on any platform. It pairs naturally 
with almost every other skill on this list.
Cross-industry examples: Accounting (invoice emails), Recruitment (application emails), 
Customer Support (ticket emails), Sales (lead enquiry emails), Legal (document delivery 
emails).

Input: PDF, DOCX, or scanned document
Output: Structured data (key-value pairs, tables, line items)
Job to be done: "I have a document — a contract, invoice, report, or form — and I need the 
important data pulled out so I can use it downstream."
Why this is high-impact: Businesses run on documents. Invoices, contracts, medical 
records, insurance claims, shipping manifests, and compliance reports all arrive as PDFs or 
Word files. A skill that can extract tables, line items, dates, amounts, and named entities 
from these documents eliminates the most tedious data-entry bottleneck in any 
organisation. It is the gateway skill for any document-heavy workflow and feeds directly 
into skills like the Calculation Engine (#13), Template Filler (#11), or Generate Excel (#16).
Cross-industry examples: Accounting (invoice line items), Legal (contract clause 
extraction), Healthcare (lab report data), Insurance (claims forms), Logistics (bills of lading).
3. Web Scrape & Collect
Category: Input
Input: URL or search query
Output: Structured data (records, lists, text blocks)
Job to be done: "I need to gather information from the web — competitor prices, job 
listings, contact details, product specs — and bring it into my workflow as clean data."
Why this is high-impact: The web is the largest unstructured data source in the world. 
Sales teams scrape leads from directories, marketers monitor competitor pricing, recruiters 
harvest job boards, and researchers collect public datasets. A reusable scraping skill that 
accepts a URL (or a list of URLs) and returns structured records is a force multiplier. It turns 
the open internet into an input source for any downstream processing or output skill.
Cross-industry examples: Sales (lead list building from LinkedIn/directories), Marketing 
(competitor price monitoring), Recruitment (job board aggregation), Research (public data 
collection), Real Estate (property listing aggregation).
4. CSV / Spreadsheet Normaliser
Category: Input
Input: Raw CSV or XLSX file (messy headers, mixed formats, duplicates)
Output: Clean, validated, consistently formatted table
Job to be done: "I've received a spreadsheet from a client, supplier, or colleague and the 
data is messy — inconsistent headers, mixed date formats, duplicates. I need it cleaned up 

before I can work with it."
Why this is high-impact: Spreadsheets are the lingua franca of business data exchange, 
but they are almost never clean. Every industry deals with incoming CSVs that need header 
mapping, deduplication, type coercion (dates, currencies), and validation. This skill sits 
between raw data arrival and any analytical or output step. Without it, every downstream 
skill has to handle dirty data individually, which is fragile and wasteful.
Cross-industry examples: Accounting (bank statement imports), HR (employee roster 
uploads), Marketing (mailing list imports), Logistics (shipment manifests), Operations 
(inventory counts).
5. Image & Receipt OCR
Category: Input
Input: Photograph or scan of a receipt, label, whiteboard, or handwritten note
Output: Structured text and data fields
Job to be done: "I have a photo of a receipt, a shipping label, or a whiteboard sketch and I 
need the text and numbers extracted as data."
Why this is high-impact: Mobile-first work means people photograph receipts for expense 
reports, snap shipping labels in warehouses, and capture whiteboard notes after meetings. 
OCR bridges the physical-to-digital gap. As a standalone skill it is reusable across expense 
management, logistics, field services, and any context where a camera is faster than a 
keyboard. It feeds naturally into the Calculation Engine (#13) or Generate Excel (#16).
Cross-industry examples: Accounting (expense receipt capture), Logistics (shipping label 
reading), Field Services (meter reading capture), Retail (price tag verification), Healthcare 
(prescription label reading).
6. Form / Survey Response Collector
Category: Input
Input: Form submission or survey response (via webhook, API, or structured file)
Output: Normalised record with validated fields
Job to be done: "People fill out forms — applications, feedback surveys, intake 
questionnaires — and I need each response captured, validated, and ready for processing."
Why this is high-impact: Forms are the structured counterpart to email. Every business 
collects information through forms: client intake, job applications, customer feedback, 
event registrations, support requests. A skill that ingests form responses, validates required 
fields, and normalises the data into a consistent schema is the starting point for countless 

workflows. It pairs with the Classifier (#10) to route responses and with Send Email (#17) to 
acknowledge receipt.
Cross-industry examples: HR (job applications), Healthcare (patient intake), Legal (client 
onboarding), Education (enrolment forms), Customer Support (bug reports), Events 
(registration).
PROCESSING SKILLS — Transforming & Enriching
7. Text Summariser
Category: Processing
Input: Long-form text (article, transcript, report, email thread)
Output: Concise summary (configurable length and style)
Job to be done: "I have a long document, meeting transcript, or email thread and I need 
the key points distilled into a short, readable summary."
Why this is high-impact: Information overload is universal. Lawyers summarise case files, 
executives summarise board reports, support agents summarise ticket histories, and 
marketers summarise competitor research. A configurable summariser — where the user 
can set the target length, tone, and focus — is one of the most frequently invoked 
processing steps in any knowledge-work workflow. It sits between almost any input skill 
and any output skill.
Cross-industry examples: Legal (case file summaries), Executive (board report briefs), 
Support (ticket history summaries), Research (literature review condensation), Sales 
(meeting recap summaries).
8. Sentiment & Tone Analyser
Category: Processing
Input: Text (review, email, chat message, survey response)
Output: Sentiment score, tone label (positive/negative/neutral, urgent/casual/formal), key 
phrases
Job to be done: "I need to understand the emotional tone of incoming messages so I can 
prioritise, route, or respond appropriately."
Why this is high-impact: Understanding tone changes the priority and routing of almost 
any communication. Support teams flag angry customers for immediate escalation. 
Marketing teams gauge campaign reception. HR teams monitor employee satisfaction in 

survey responses. Product teams analyse app store reviews. A sentiment skill is a 
lightweight but high-leverage processing step that adds a decision-making signal to any 
text-based workflow.
Cross-industry examples: Customer Support (ticket urgency scoring), Marketing 
(campaign feedback analysis), HR (employee pulse survey analysis), Product (app review 
monitoring), Sales (deal risk assessment from email tone).
9. Data Enrichment & Lookup
Category: Processing
Input: Partial record (e.g., company name, email address, domain)
Output: Enriched record (full company details, social profiles, industry, revenue, location)
Job to be done: "I have a name, email, or domain and I need to fill in the missing details — 
company size, industry, location, social profiles — so I can qualify, segment, or personalise."
Why this is high-impact: Partial data is everywhere. A sales lead comes in with just an 
email. A marketing list has company names but no industry codes. A recruitment pipeline 
has candidate names but no LinkedIn URLs. An enrichment skill that can take a thin record 
and return a fat one — by calling public APIs, searching the web, or querying databases — is 
a critical middle step. It dramatically increases the value of any lead, contact, or prospect 
list.
Cross-industry examples: Sales (lead enrichment), Marketing (audience segmentation), 
Recruitment (candidate profiling), Finance (KYC / vendor verification), Real Estate (buyer 
profiling).
10. Classifier & Triage Router
Category: Processing
Input: Unstructured item (email, ticket, document, form response)
Output: Category label + routing instruction (e.g., "Billing Issue → Finance Team")
Job to be done: "Incoming items need to be sorted into categories and sent to the right 
person or queue — automatically, without someone reading every single one."
Why this is high-impact: Triage is the hidden bottleneck in every organisation. Support 
tickets need categorising. Emails need routing. Legal documents need classifying by type. 
Insurance claims need sorting by severity. A classifier skill that can read an item, assign it to 
a predefined category, and output a routing instruction is the connective tissue between 
input skills and the rest of the workflow. It replaces the manual "someone reads it and 
decides where it goes" step that exists in every business.

Cross-industry examples: Customer Support (ticket categorisation), Legal (document type 
classification), Insurance (claims severity triage), IT (incident priority routing), HR 
(application screening), Operations (procurement request routing).
11. Template Filler / Mail-Merge
Category: Processing
Input: Template (with placeholders) + data record(s)
Output: Populated document(s) — one per record
Job to be done: "I have a template — a letter, contract, proposal, or report layout — and a 
set of data. I need each record merged into the template to produce a finished document."
Why this is high-impact: Mail-merge is one of the oldest automation patterns and it 
remains one of the most universally needed. Accountants merge client data into 
engagement letters. Lawyers merge case details into court filings. Marketers merge 
audience segments into personalised emails. HR merges employee data into offer letters. A 
template-filler skill is the bridge between structured data and finished documents, and it 
pairs directly with the PDF (#15), Excel (#16), and Email (#17) output skills.
Cross-industry examples: Legal (contract generation), Accounting (engagement letters), 
HR (offer letters), Marketing (personalised campaigns), Sales (proposal generation), 
Education (certificates).
12. Translation & Localisation
Category: Processing
Input: Text in source language
Output: Text in target language (with optional locale-specific formatting for dates, 
currencies, units)
Job to be done: "I have content in one language and need it accurately translated — and 
ideally localised — for a different market or audience."
Why this is high-impact: Any business that operates internationally or serves multilingual 
customers needs translation. E-commerce product listings, customer support responses, 
marketing copy, legal documents, and internal communications all require translation. A 
skill that handles not just word-for-word translation but also locale-aware formatting (date 
formats, currency symbols, measurement units) is reusable across every industry with an 
international footprint.
Cross-industry examples: E-commerce (product listing translation), Customer Support 
(multilingual ticket responses), Marketing (campaign localisation), Legal (contract 

translation), Tourism (booking confirmation localisation).
13. Calculation & Formula Engine
Category: Processing
Input: Numbers + rules/formulas (e.g., tax rates, discount tiers, unit conversions)
Output: Computed result (totals, margins, projections, converted values)
Job to be done: "I need to apply business rules — tax calculations, pricing formulas, unit 
conversions, financial projections — to a set of numbers and get a reliable result."
Why this is high-impact: Every industry has calculations that sit between raw data and a 
final deliverable. Accountants calculate VAT. Logistics companies calculate shipping costs. 
Retailers calculate margin and discount tiers. Engineers calculate material quantities. A 
formula engine skill that accepts numbers and a rule set (or formula) and returns computed 
results is a critical processing step that prevents users from having to embed business logic 
into every individual workflow. It is the "spreadsheet brain" of the platform.
Cross-industry examples: Accounting (tax calculations, profit margins), Logistics (shipping 
cost estimation), Retail (pricing and discount calculations), Finance (loan amortisation, 
interest), Engineering (material quantity calculations), HR (payroll calculations).
14. Compliance & Policy Checker
Category: Processing
Input: Document or data record + rule set (regulations, internal policies, checklists)
Output: Pass/fail status + list of issues/violations with references
Job to be done: "I need to check whether a document, process, or data set complies with a 
specific set of rules — regulatory requirements, internal policies, or industry standards."
Why this is high-impact: Compliance is a universal concern that spans every regulated 
industry. Financial services check transactions against AML rules. Healthcare organisations 
verify HIPAA compliance. Legal teams review contracts against internal policies. HR 
departments check job postings against employment law. A compliance checker skill that 
can take a document and a rule set and return a pass/fail verdict with specific issues cited is 
high-value because non-compliance carries real financial and legal risk. It is also one of the 
hardest tasks to do manually at scale.
Cross-industry examples: Finance (AML/KYC checks), Healthcare (HIPAA compliance), 
Legal (contract policy review), HR (employment law compliance), Manufacturing (safety 
regulation checks), Real Estate (disclosure requirement verification).

OUTPUT SKILLS — Delivering Results
15. Generate PDF Report
Category: Output
Input: Structured data + layout/template instructions
Output: Formatted PDF file
Job to be done: "I need to turn my data and analysis into a professional, shareable PDF 
report that looks polished and is ready to send to a client, manager, or regulator."
Why this is high-impact: PDF is the universal format for formal business deliverables. 
Accountants deliver financial statements as PDFs. Consultants deliver reports. Lawyers 
deliver briefs. Marketers deliver campaign reports. Healthcare providers deliver patient 
summaries. A skill that takes structured data and a layout specification and produces a 
clean, branded PDF is the final mile of countless workflows. It is the skill that turns internal 
data into an external-facing deliverable.
Cross-industry examples: Accounting (financial statements), Consulting (client reports), 
Legal (case briefs), Marketing (campaign performance reports), Healthcare (patient 
discharge summaries), Real Estate (property valuation reports).
16. Generate Excel / Spreadsheet
Category: Output
Input: Structured data + optional formatting rules (headers, formulas, conditional 
formatting)
Output: XLSX file with formatted sheets, formulas, and charts
Job to be done: "I need to deliver data in a spreadsheet that the recipient can open, filter, 
sort, and work with — not just a static report, but a live, editable file."
Why this is high-impact: While PDF is for final deliverables, Excel is for working 
deliverables. Clients expect to receive data they can manipulate. Accountants deliver trial 
balances. Operations managers deliver inventory reports. HR delivers headcount analyses. 
A skill that can produce a properly formatted XLSX — with headers, data types, formulas, 
and even conditional formatting — is essential because it respects the recipient's need to 
interact with the data. It pairs with the CSV Normaliser (#4) on the input side and the 
Calculation Engine (#13) on the processing side.
Cross-industry examples: Accounting (trial balances, ledgers), HR (headcount reports), 
Operations (inventory reports), Finance (budget models), Marketing (campaign data 
exports), Logistics (shipment tracking sheets).

17. Send Email (Compose & Deliver)
Category: Output
Input: Recipient(s), subject, body content (from template or generated text), optional 
attachments
Output: Sent email (with delivery confirmation)
Job to be done: "I need to send an email — a notification, a report, a follow-up, or a 
personalised message — as the final step of my workflow."
Why this is high-impact: Email is the most universal output channel. Every workflow that 
involves communicating a result to a person ends with an email: sending an invoice, 
confirming an appointment, delivering a report, following up with a lead, notifying a team 
member. A send-email skill that can compose a message (from a template or generated 
content), attach files (from the PDF or Excel skills), and deliver it is the most commonly used 
final step on any automation platform. It is the output counterpart to Email Ingest (#1).
Cross-industry examples: All industries — invoice delivery, appointment confirmations, 
report distribution, lead follow-ups, internal notifications, customer acknowledgements.
18. Calendar Event Creator
Category: Output
Input: Date, time, duration, title, description, attendees
Output: Calendar event (Google Calendar, Outlook, iCal)
Job to be done: "I need to create a calendar event — a meeting, a deadline, a reminder, or 
a booking — as the result of my workflow."
Why this is high-impact: Scheduling is a cross-industry need that touches every role. Sales 
reps book demos. Recruiters schedule interviews. Healthcare clinics book appointments. 
Legal teams set court date reminders. Project managers create milestone deadlines. A 
calendar skill that can create, update, or cancel events across major calendar platforms is a 
high-frequency output step. It pairs naturally with the Email Ingest (#1) skill (extracting 
dates from emails) and the Classifier (#10) skill (routing scheduling requests).
Cross-industry examples: Sales (demo scheduling), Recruitment (interview booking), 
Healthcare (patient appointments), Legal (court date reminders), Education (class 
scheduling), Services (client booking).
19. Structured Data Push (API / Webhook)
Category: Output

Input: Structured data payload (JSON)
Output: Delivered to external system via API call or webhook (CRM, ERP, database, Slack, 
etc.)
Job to be done: "I need to push the result of my workflow into another system — update a 
CRM record, add a row to a database, post a message to Slack, or trigger another workflow."
Why this is high-impact: Not every workflow ends with a human-readable document. 
Many end by updating a system of record: adding a lead to a CRM, updating an inventory 
count in an ERP, posting a notification to Slack, or triggering a downstream webhook. A 
generic "push data to an API" skill is the most flexible output primitive on the platform. It 
makes every workflow extensible by allowing it to connect to any system with an API. 
Without this skill, the platform is a closed loop; with it, the platform becomes a node in a 
larger ecosystem.
Cross-industry examples: Sales (CRM updates), Operations (ERP inventory updates), IT 
(Slack/Teams notifications), Marketing (audience list pushes to ad platforms), Finance 
(accounting system journal entries), All (webhook triggers for downstream workflows).
20. Dashboard / Chart Generator
Category: Output
Input: Dataset (table or time series) + chart type specification
Output: Visual chart (PNG image or interactive HTML) or mini-dashboard
Job to be done: "I need to turn my data into a visual — a bar chart, line graph, pie chart, or 
simple dashboard — so that stakeholders can understand the story at a glance."
Why this is high-impact: Data without visualisation is data without impact. Executives 
want dashboards, not spreadsheets. Marketers want campaign performance charts. 
Finance teams want revenue trend lines. Operations managers want throughput graphs. A 
chart generator skill that can take a dataset and a chart specification and produce a clean 
visual — either as a static image (for embedding in PDFs or emails) or as interactive HTML 
(for dashboards) — is the skill that turns raw analysis into persuasive communication. It 
pairs with the PDF Report (#15) and Send Email (#17) skills to deliver visual reports.
Cross-industry examples: Finance (revenue trend charts), Marketing (campaign 
performance dashboards), Operations (throughput and efficiency graphs), HR (headcount 
and attrition visuals), Sales (pipeline funnel charts), Executive (KPI dashboards).

Design Principles Applied
1.Input diversity: The six input skills cover the major data entry points — email, 
documents, web, spreadsheets, images, and forms — ensuring the platform can ingest 
data from virtually any source a business encounters.
2.Processing generality: The eight processing skills are deliberately domain-agnostic. A 
summariser does not care whether it is summarising a legal brief or a marketing report. 
A classifier does not care whether it is triaging support tickets or insurance claims. This 
generality is what makes them reusable across industries.
3.Output format coverage: The six output skills cover the major delivery formats — PDF 
(formal), Excel (interactive), Email (communication), Calendar (scheduling), API (system 
integration), and Charts (visual). Together they ensure that any workflow can deliver its 
result in the format the recipient expects.
4.Composability over completeness: Rather than building 100 narrow, industry-specific 
skills, these 20 general-purpose skills can be composed into thousands of industry-
specific workflows. The platform's value comes from the combinations, not the 
individual pieces.
Expanded Skills (21-50)
INPUT SKILLS (Continued)
21. Audio / Video Transcription
Category: Input
Input: Audio or video file (MP3, WAV, MP4, etc.)
Output: Text transcript with optional speaker diarization and timestamps
Job to be done: "I have a recording of a meeting, interview, or podcast, and I need a 
written transcript to search, summarise, or repurpose."
Why this is high-impact: As video and audio become primary communication channels, 
the need to convert spoken words into text is universal. Sales teams transcribe sales calls 
for coaching. Marketers transcribe webinars to create blog posts. Researchers transcribe 
interviews for analysis. A transcription skill is the gateway to applying any text-based 
processing skill (like Summariser #7 or Classifier #10) to audio/video content.
Cross-industry examples: Sales (call transcription), Marketing (webinar transcription), HR 
(interview transcription), Media (podcast transcription), Legal (deposition transcription).

22. QR / Barcode Scanner
Category: Input
Input: Image containing a QR code or barcode
Output: The encoded data (URL, product ID, text)
Why this is high-impact: QR codes and barcodes are the physical world's hyperlinks. They 
are used on packaging, in warehouses, on marketing materials, and at events. A skill that 
can read these codes from an image allows workflows to be triggered from physical objects. 
It bridges the gap between the physical and digital worlds in a structured way, making it 
essential for logistics, retail, and event management.
Cross-industry examples: Logistics (inventory scanning), Retail (product information 
lookup), Marketing (event check-in, campaign tracking), Manufacturing (work-in-progress 
tracking).
PROCESSING SKILLS (Continued)
23. Data Validation & Formatting
Category: Processing
Input: Data record with potentially invalid fields (e.g., phone numbers, emails, addresses)
Output: Validated record with standardised formatting, plus an error report
Job to be done: "I need to ensure the data I've collected is valid and consistently formatted 
— phone numbers in E.164 format, emails are valid, postcodes are correct — before I use it."
Why this is high-impact: Dirty data is the enemy of automation. Invalid email addresses 
cause bounces. Incorrectly formatted phone numbers prevent outreach. Bad addresses 
lead to failed deliveries. A data validation skill that cleans and standardises contact 
information is a crucial pre-processing step for any workflow that involves communication 
or shipping. It's the quality control gate for your data.
Cross-industry examples: Sales/Marketing (contact list cleaning), E-commerce (shipping 
address validation), Finance (customer data validation), HR (employee record 
standardisation).
24. Document Comparison (Diff & Redline)
Category: Processing
Input: Two versions of a document (text, DOCX, PDF)

Output: A new document showing the differences (a
'redline' view) or a structured list of changes.
Job to be done: "I need to compare two versions of a contract, proposal, or manuscript to 
see exactly what has changed, without missing a single comma."
Why this is high-impact: Version control is critical in legal, sales, and creative fields. 
Lawyers redline contracts. Sales teams track changes in proposals. Editors review 
manuscript revisions. A document comparison skill that can reliably highlight every 
addition, deletion, and modification is a massive time-saver and risk-reducer. It replaces 
the painstaking and error-prone manual review process.
Cross-industry examples: Legal (contract negotiation), Sales (proposal revisions), 
Procurement (RFP updates), Writing/Editing (manuscript changes), Compliance (policy 
updates).
25. Approval Chain Router
Category: Processing
Input: A request (e.g., for purchase, leave, publication) + associated data (amount, 
department)
Output: Routing decision for the next approver in a multi-step chain
Job to be done: "I need to route requests for approval through a specific chain of 
command, where the next step depends on rules like the amount or department."
Why this is high-impact: Many business processes require multi-step approvals. A 
purchase order might need manager approval, then finance approval if over a certain 
amount. A blog post might need editorial approval, then legal approval. This skill 
automates the routing logic, ensuring requests go to the right people in the right order, with 
escalations for delays. It's the engine of any workflow that requires sign-off.
Cross-industry examples: Finance (purchase order approvals), HR (leave requests), 
Marketing (campaign budget approvals), Legal (document sign-off), IT (access requests).
26. Deadline & Reminder Engine
Category: Processing
Input: A date, a task, and a reminder schedule (e.g., "remind 3 days before, 1 day before, 
and on the day")
Output: Scheduled notifications

Job to be done: "I need to track important dates and deadlines and automatically send 
reminders to the right people at the right times so nothing falls through the cracks."
Why this is high-impact: Forgetting deadlines has real consequences. Missed legal filings, 
late project deliveries, and forgotten contract renewals all create risk and cost money. A 
reminder engine that can be programmed with a set of dates and a notification cadence is a 
universal safety net. It's a proactive skill that prevents problems before they happen.
Cross-industry examples: Legal (filing deadlines), Project Management (task reminders), 
Sales (follow-up reminders), HR (performance review deadlines), Finance (payment 
reminders).
27. Content Generation (Blog Post / Article)
Category: Processing
Input: A topic, keywords, and an outline or source material
Output: A draft article or blog post
Job to be done: "I need to create a well-structured, SEO-friendly blog post or article based 
on a topic or a set of notes, without starting from a blank page."
Why this is high-impact: Content marketing is a core function for almost every business, 
but it's time-consuming. A skill that can take a brief or an outline and generate a coherent 
first draft frees up marketers and writers to focus on editing, strategy, and promotion. It's a 
powerful content creation accelerator.
Cross-industry examples: Marketing (blog posts, articles), HR (internal communications), 
Sales (educational content for leads), PR (press releases).
28. Content Repurposing (Long-form to Social)
Category: Processing
Input: A long-form piece of content (article, video transcript, webinar recording)
Output: A set of short-form social media posts (e.g., for Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook)
Job to be done: "I have a great piece of long-form content, and I need to break it down into 
a series of engaging social media posts to maximize its reach."
Why this is high-impact: Creating content is only half the battle; distributing it is the other 
half. This skill automates the process of extracting key quotes, ideas, and takeaways from a 
single large asset and formatting them for different social platforms. It multiplies the ROI of 
every piece of content created.

Cross-industry examples: Marketing (repurposing blog posts), Media (repurposing 
articles), Education (repurposing lectures), Corporate Comms (repurposing 
announcements).
29. Knowledge Base Q&A
Category: Processing
Input: A question + a designated knowledge base (a collection of documents)
Output: A direct answer synthesized from the knowledge base, with source citations
Job to be done: "I need to get a direct answer to my question by searching through our 
company's internal documentation, without having to read through dozens of files."
Why this is high-impact: As companies grow, finding information in internal wikis, 
intranets, and document stores becomes a major productivity drain. A Q&A skill that uses 
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to find relevant information and synthesize a direct 
answer is a game-changer for internal support, HR, and any knowledge-intensive role. It 
turns a messy document library into a searchable oracle.
Cross-industry examples: IT/HR Support (internal helpdesks), Customer Support (agent 
assistance), R&D (research retrieval), Sales Enablement (product information queries).
30. File Format Converter
Category: Processing
Input: A file in one format (e.g., DOCX, PNG, XLSX)
Output: The same file converted to another format (e.g., PDF, JPG, CSV)
Job to be done: "I have a file in one format, but I need it in another format for a specific 
purpose — a Word doc needs to be a PDF for sharing, a PNG needs to be a JPG for the web."
Why this is high-impact: File format incompatibility is a constant, low-level friction point 
in business. This skill acts as a universal adapter, ensuring that files are always in the right 
format for the next step in the workflow. It's a simple but essential utility that makes many 
other skills work together seamlessly.
Cross-industry examples: All industries — converting documents to PDF, images for web 
use, spreadsheets to CSV for import.
31. Document Merger / Splitter
Category: Processing
Input: Multiple documents to merge, or one document to split with rules

Output: A single merged document, or multiple smaller documents
Job to be done: "I need to combine several PDFs into a single report, or I need to split a 
large document into separate chapters or sections."
Why this is high-impact: Assembling and disassembling documents is a common 
administrative task. Legal teams merge exhibits into a single filing. HR teams assemble 
onboarding packets. Accountants split large reports for different departments. This skill 
automates the digital equivalent of a stapler and a staple remover, saving time and 
reducing errors in document preparation.
Cross-industry examples: Legal (merging case files), HR (assembling onboarding packets), 
Finance (splitting reports), Real Estate (combining transaction documents).
32. Deduplication Engine
Category: Processing
Input: A list of records (contacts, companies, products) with potential duplicates
Output: A single, clean list with duplicates removed or merged
Job to be done: "I have a list of contacts or products that I know has duplicates, and I need 
to clean it up so I have a single source of truth."
Why this is high-impact: Duplicate data corrupts marketing campaigns, skews sales 
reporting, and leads to wasted effort. A deduplication skill that can identify and merge 
duplicate records based on fuzzy matching (e.g., "John Smith" vs. "J. Smith") is essential for 
maintaining data hygiene in any CRM, ERP, or marketing automation system.
Cross-industry examples: Sales/Marketing (CRM contact deduplication), E-commerce 
(product catalogue deduplication), Operations (inventory list cleaning), HR (candidate 
database deduplication).
33. Price & Feature Comparator
Category: Processing
Input: A list of products or services with their attributes (from web scraping or a database)
Output: A structured comparison table or a "best value" recommendation based on criteria
Job to be done: "I need to compare the prices and features of competing products or 
services to make a purchasing decision or to position my own product."
Why this is high-impact: Comparison shopping is a fundamental business activity, 
whether for procurement, competitive analysis, or personal use. This skill automates the 
process of gathering data from multiple sources and presenting it in a structured, easy-to-

compare format. It supports better purchasing decisions and provides valuable market 
intelligence.
Cross-industry examples: Procurement (supplier price comparison), Marketing 
(competitive analysis), IT (software purchasing decisions), Finance (investment option 
comparison).
34. Image Editor (Resize, Crop, Watermark)
Category: Processing
Input: An image file + editing instructions (dimensions, coordinates, watermark image)
Output: An edited image file
Why this is high-impact: Images rarely come in the exact format needed. Website banners 
need to be a specific size, social media posts require different aspect ratios, and marketing 
materials need to be watermarked. An image editing skill that can automate these basic 
transformations saves countless hours for marketing, web, and creative teams.
Cross-industry examples: Marketing (resizing images for web and social), E-commerce 
(cropping product photos), Photography (batch watermarking), Real Estate (resizing 
property photos).
35. Proposal & Quote Generator
Category: Processing
Input: Client details, a list of line items (products/services), and pricing rules
Output: A formatted proposal or quote document (PDF or DOCX)
Job to be done: "I need to quickly generate a professional-looking proposal or quote for a 
client based on their specific needs, without manually creating the document each time."
Why this is high-impact: For any service-based business, from freelancers to large 
agencies, generating proposals is a constant and critical sales activity. This skill automates 
the creation of these documents, pulling in client data, calculating prices based on selected 
services, and formatting it all into a polished template. It dramatically speeds up the sales 
cycle.
Cross-industry examples: Agencies (client proposals), Freelancers (project quotes), Sales 
Teams (sales quotes), Construction (bids and estimates), Event Planning (service quotes).
OUTPUT SKILLS (Continued)

36. Text-to-Speech (Audio Generation)
Category: Output
Input: Text content
Output: An audio file (MP3) of the text being read
Job to be done: "I need to turn this article (or these notes) into an audio file so I can listen 
to it, or so I can create a voiceover for a video."
Why this is high-impact: Audio is a powerful and convenient medium. This skill makes any 
text-based content accessible to people who prefer to listen, such as commuters or those 
with visual impairments. It also enables the creation of audio-first content like podcast 
snippets or video voiceovers without hiring a voice actor.
Cross-industry examples: Media (article narration), Education (lesson audio), Marketing 
(video voiceovers), Accessibility (content for visually impaired users).
37. Image Generation
Category: Output
Input: A descriptive text prompt
Output: An AI-generated image file
Job to be done: "I need a unique image for my blog post, presentation, or social media 
campaign, but I don't have a budget for stock photos or a designer."
Why this is high-impact: Visual content is essential for engagement, but creating it can be 
expensive and time-consuming. An AI image generation skill allows anyone to create 
custom visuals on demand, providing a nearly infinite source of royalty-free images for 
marketing, content creation, and internal presentations.
Cross-industry examples: Marketing (blog and social media images), Content Creation 
(article illustrations), Design (prototyping and mood boards), Education (presentation 
visuals).
38. QR / Barcode Generator
Category: Output
Input: Data to be encoded (URL, product ID, contact info)
Output: A QR code or barcode image file
Job to be done: "I need to create a QR code for my event check-in, a barcode for my 
product packaging, or a vCard QR code for my business card."

Why this is high-impact: This is the output counterpart to the QR/Barcode Scanner (#22). It 
allows workflows to create the physical-digital links that other workflows can then 
consume. It's essential for any process that involves labelling, tracking, or linking physical 
items to digital information.
Cross-industry examples: Logistics (generating shipping labels), Retail (creating product 
barcodes), Marketing (generating QR codes for campaigns), Events (creating check-in QR 
codes).
39. Digital Signature Requester
Category: Output
Input: A document + signer's email address
Output: A request sent via a digital signature platform (e.g., DocuSign) and a status update
Job to be done: "I need to get this contract or agreement legally signed by a client, 
employee, or partner."
Why this is high-impact: Getting documents signed is the final step for many critical 
business processes — closing a sale, hiring an employee, onboarding a new client. This skill 
automates the process of sending a document for signature and tracking its status, 
integrating the workflow with legally binding e-signature platforms.
Cross-industry examples: Sales (contract signing), HR (offer letter signing), Legal 
(agreement signing), Real Estate (lease signing), Finance (loan document signing).
40. File Encryption & Password Protection
Category: Output
Input: A file + a password or encryption key
Output: An encrypted or password-protected version of the file
Job to be done: "I need to send this sensitive document securely, ensuring that only the 
intended recipient with the password can open it."
Why this is high-impact: Data security is paramount. When sending sensitive financial, 
legal, or personal information, password protection is a basic requirement. This skill 
provides a crucial security layer to any workflow that handles confidential data, ensuring 
that documents are protected before they are sent or stored.
Cross-industry examples: Finance (sending financial reports), HR (sending payroll 
information), Legal (sharing confidential case files), Healthcare (transmitting patient data).

41. Social Media Publisher
Category: Output
Input: Content (text, image, or video) + target social media platform(s)
Output: A published post on the selected platform(s)
Job to be done: "I have my content ready, and I need to post it to my company's LinkedIn, 
Twitter, and Facebook pages."
Why this is high-impact: This skill is the final step in the content marketing lifecycle. After 
content is generated (#27) and repurposed (#28), it needs to be published. A social media 
publisher skill that can connect to major platforms and post content directly from the 
workflow saves marketers from having to manually upload content to each platform.
Cross-industry examples: Marketing (publishing campaigns), PR (distributing 
announcements), HR (posting job openings), Sales (sharing industry articles).
42. Database Row Inserter / Updater
Category: Output
Input: A structured data record + database connection details and table name
Output: Confirmation of the database write/update operation
Job to be done: "I need to log the results of my workflow by adding a new row to my SQL 
database or updating an existing one."
Why this is high-impact: While the API Push skill (#19) is for connecting to external 
systems, this skill is for direct interaction with a company's own databases. It's a 
fundamental building block for any workflow that needs to interact with a system of record 
that is a traditional database. It allows workflows to act as data sources for internal 
analytics and operations.
Cross-industry examples: All industries — logging workflow results, updating customer 
records, recording transactions, tracking inventory.
43. HTML Page Generator
Category: Output
Input: Content (text, images, charts) + layout instructions
Output: A standalone HTML file or a public URL for a simple webpage
Job to be done: "I need to create a simple, shareable webpage — a landing page, a project 
status page, or a public report — from my data."

Why this is high-impact: Sometimes a PDF is too static and an email is too informal. A 
simple, clean webpage is the perfect medium for sharing dynamic information. This skill 
allows users to create lightweight web-based deliverables without needing a full web 
development environment. It's perfect for creating temporary landing pages, sharing 
interactive reports, or publishing project updates.
Cross-industry examples: Marketing (microsites/landing pages), Project Management 
(status pages), Sales (personalized demo pages), Research (publishing findings).
44. Archive Creator (Zip)
Category: Output
Input: A list of files
Output: A single compressed Zip archive containing all the files
Job to be done: "I need to package up a collection of documents, images, and 
spreadsheets into a single file to make it easy to send or download."
Why this is high-impact: Sending a large number of files individually is cumbersome. A Zip 
archive is the standard way to bundle multiple files together. This skill automates the 
process of collecting and compressing files, making it a crucial utility for any workflow that 
generates multiple outputs.
Cross-industry examples: All industries — packaging project deliverables, archiving 
records, preparing files for download.
45. Personalized Video Generator
Category: Output
Input: A video template + personalization data (e.g., customer name, company logo)
Output: A personalized video file
Job to be done: "I want to send a personalized video to each new customer, welcoming 
them by name and showing them features relevant to their industry."
Why this is high-impact: Personalized video is a powerful tool for engagement in sales and 
marketing. This skill allows for the creation of customized videos at scale, which can 
dramatically increase open rates, click-through rates, and customer satisfaction. It takes the 
idea of mail-merge (#11) and applies it to video.
Cross-industry examples: Marketing (personalized welcome videos), Sales (customized 
outreach videos), E-commerce (personalized thank-you videos), HR (personalized 
onboarding videos).

46. Voice Call Placer (IVR)
Category: Output
Input: A phone number + a script (text-to-speech) or audio file
Output: A placed phone call with interaction logging
Job to be done: "I need to automatically call a customer to confirm an appointment, 
remind them of a payment, or provide an update on their order."
Why this is high-impact: For time-sensitive notifications like appointment reminders or 
fraud alerts, a phone call is often more effective than an email. This skill allows workflows 
to initiate automated voice calls, delivering information and even capturing simple 
responses via an interactive voice response (IVR) system. It's a powerful tool for proactive 
communication.
Cross-industry examples: Healthcare (appointment reminders), Finance (payment 
reminders, fraud alerts), Logistics (delivery notifications), Services (appointment 
confirmations).
47. Chat Message Sender (Slack/Teams)
Category: Output
Input: A message + a target channel or user
Output: A posted message in the specified chat platform
Job to be done: "I need to notify my team in our Slack channel whenever a new high-
priority support ticket comes in, or when a major sale is closed."
Why this is high-impact: Internal communication has largely moved from email to chat 
platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams. This skill allows workflows to integrate directly 
into these conversational hubs, providing real-time notifications and updates where the 
team is already working. It's the primary output skill for internal-facing workflows.
Cross-industry examples: All industries — sales win notifications, high-priority support 
ticket alerts, project status updates, new employee announcements.
48. Contact Card Generator (vCard)
Category: Output
Input: Contact information (name, title, company, phone, email)
Output: A vCard file (.vcf)

Job to be done: "I want to make it easy for people to add my contact information to their 
address book by providing a downloadable vCard file."
Why this is high-impact: A vCard is the standard format for sharing contact information 
digitally. This skill automates the creation of these files, which can then be attached to 
emails, linked from websites, or embedded in QR codes. It's a small but important utility 
that reduces friction in networking and sales.
Cross-industry examples: Sales/Marketing (email signatures), Networking (digital 
business cards), Events (attendee contact sharing).
49. Word Document Generator
Category: Output
Input: Content + formatting instructions
Output: A formatted DOCX file
Job to be done: "I need to generate a Word document, not a PDF, because the recipient 
needs to be able to edit it or track changes."
Why this is high-impact: While PDF is for final, locked-down documents, Word is for 
collaborative, living documents. This skill is the output for any workflow that produces a 
document that is expected to be edited by the recipient, such as a first draft of a contract, a 
collaborative report, or a proposal that requires input.
Cross-industry examples: Legal (draft contracts), Consulting (collaborative reports), 
Writing/Editing (manuscripts), HR (performance review templates).
50. Task Creator (Asana, Jira, etc.)
Category: Output
Input: Task details (title, description, assignee, due date) + project management tool 
connection
Output: A new task created in the specified project management tool
Job to be done: "When a new bug is reported in a support ticket, I need to automatically 
create a new issue in Jira for the engineering team to investigate."
Why this is high-impact: Workflows often identify work that needs to be done by a human. 
This skill acts as the bridge between the automation and the human workflow, creating 
tasks in the project management systems that teams already use. It ensures that actions 
identified by a workflow are tracked and completed.

Cross-industry examples: IT/Software (bug tracking in Jira), Marketing (creative requests 
in Asana), Client Services (onboarding tasks in Trello), Operations (process tasks in 
Monday.com).
